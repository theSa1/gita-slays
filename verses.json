    "chapter_summary": "The first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita - \"Arjuna Vishada Yoga\" introduces the setup, the setting, the characters and the circumstances that led to the epic battle of Mahabharata, fought between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. It outlines the reasons that led to the revelation of the of Bhagavad Gita.\nAs both armies stand ready for the battle, the mighty warrior Arjuna, on observing the warriors on both sides becomes increasingly sad and depressed due to the fear of losing his relatives and friends and the consequent sins attributed to killing his own relatives. So, he surrenders to Lord Krishna, seeking a solution. Thus, follows the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita.",
    "chapter_summary_hindi": "भगवद गीता का पहला अध्याय अर्जुन विशाद योग उन पात्रों और परिस्थितियों का परिचय कराता है जिनके कारण पांडवों और कौरवों के बीच महाभारत का महासंग्राम हुआ। यह अध्याय उन कारणों का वर्णन करता है जिनके कारण भगवद गीता का ईश्वरावेश हुआ। जब महाबली योद्धा अर्जुन दोनों पक्षों पर युद्ध के लिए तैयार खड़े योद्धाओं को देखते हैं तो वह अपने ही रिश्तेदारों एवं मित्रों को खोने के डर तथा फलस्वरूप पापों के कारण दुखी और उदास हो जाते हैं। इसलिए वह श्री कृष्ण को पूरी तरह से आत्मसमर्पण करते हैं। इस प्रकार, भगवद गीता के ज्ञान का प्रकाश होता है।",

    "chapter_summary_hindi": "भगवद गीता का दूसरा अध्याय सांख्य योग है। यह अध्याय भगवद गीता का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण अध्याय है क्योंकि इसमें भगवान श्रीकृष्ण संपूर्ण गीता की शिक्षाओं को संघनित करते हैं। यह अध्याय पूरी गीता का सार है। सांख्य योग को 4 मुख्य विषयों में वर्गीकृत किया जा सकता है - १. अर्जुन ने पूरी तरह से भगवान कृष्ण को आत्मसमर्पण किया और उन्हें अपने गुरु के रूप में स्वीकार किया। २. सभी दु:खों के मुख्य कारणों की व्याख्या, जो स्व की वास्तविक प्रकृति की अज्ञानता है। ३. कर्मयोग - अपने कर्मों के फलों से जुड़े बिना नि:स्वार्थ क्रिया का अनुशासन। ४. एक परिपूर्ण मनुष्य का विवरण - जिसका मस्तिष्क स्थिर और एक-इशारा है।",

Though you speak words of wisdom? you are unwise because you grieve for those who are really eternal and who deserve no grief. They who are endowed with the knowledge of the Self are wise men. They will not grieve for the living or for the dead because they know well that the Self is immortal and that It is unborn. They also know that there is no such a thing as death? that it is a separation of the astral body from the physical? that death is nothing more than a disintegration of matter and that the five elements of which the body is composed return to their source. Arjuna had forgotten the eternal nature of the Soul and the changing nature of the body. Because of his ignorance? he began to act as if the temporary relations with kinsmen? teachers? etc.? were permanent. He forgot that his relations with this world in his present life were the results of past actions.

Even though you're spittin' some serious wisdom, you're tripping if you're stressing over peeps who are basically eternal and don't need your pity party. Real Gs, people who are enlightened, don't even trip about the living or the dead 'cause they know the soul is immortal and doesn't even get born or die. It's not even a thing. Death? It's just the astral body bouncing from the physical, matter breaking down, elements returning to their source. Arjuna, you're buggin'. You forgot the soul's eternal, the body's temporary. You're acting like your fam and teachers are permanent, but that's not how it works. These relationships are all about past karma, and when that's done, it's done. New relationships pop up when you get a new body. It's all about prarabdha karma, the karma that made this life happen."

No risk, no uncertainty. And, like, there's no way you're gonna get hurt. Doctors? They can totally mess up and hurt you. But Karma Yoga? Nah. Even the tiniest bit of effort on this path saves you from the total nightmare of reincarnation. Krishna's basically hyping up Karma Yoga to Arjuna, trying to get him on board."

They are highly enamoured of such Vedic passages which prescribe ways for the attainment of heavenly enjoyments. They say that there is nothing else beyond the sensual enjoyments in Svarga (heaven) which can be obtained by performing the rites of the Karma Kanda of the Vedas.There are two main divisions of the Vedas -- Karma Kanda (the section dealing with action) and Jnana Kanda (the section dealing with knowledge). The Karma Kanda comprises the Brahmanas and the Samhitas. This is the authority for the Purvamimamsa school founded by Jaimini. The followers of this school deal with rituals and prescribe many of them for attaining enjoyments and power here and happiness in heaven. They regard this as the ultimate object of human existence. Ordinary people are attracted by their panegyrics. The Jnana Kanda comprises the Aranyakas and the Upanishads which deal with the nature of Brahman or the Supreme Self.Life in heaven is also transitory. After the fruits of the good actions are exhausted? one has to come back to this earthplane. Liberatio or Moksha can only be attained by knowledge of the Self but not by performing a thousand and one sacrifices.Lord Krishna assigns a comparatively inferior position to the doctrine of the Mimamsakas of performing Vedic sacrifices for obtaining heaven? power and lordship in this world as they cannot give us final liberation.",

The Karma Kanda peeps are all about those heavenly rewards, but, like, that's not the tea. Heaven's temporary, fam. Real liberation? That's about knowing yourself, not about doing a million sacrifices. Krishna's, like, 'Nah, that whole heaven thing? It's not the ultimate goal. It's not gonna get you true freedom.'"

The Self, Atman, or Brahman is 'night' for normies, but the sage is wide awake, totally connected to the ultimate reality, the brightest light. They're illuminated, totally self-aware."

Human temperaments and tendencies vary according to the Gunas.Though the Lord is the author of the caste system? yet He is not the author as He is the nondoer. He is not subject to Samsara.

It's all about the energy (gunas) and the actions (karma). Brahmins are all about the good vibes, super chill and pure. Kshatriyas are the go-getters, all about power and leadership. Vaishyas are the hustlers, focused on business and stuff. Shudras are more about supporting the other groups. It's all about the balance, fam. If everyone does their thing, society is lit.

If this idea vanishes? action is no action at all. It will not bind one to Samsara. This is inaction in action. If you stand as s spectator or silent witness of Natures activities? feeling Nature does everything I am nondoer (Akarta)? if you identify yourself with the actionless Self? no matter what work or how much of it is done? action is no action at all. This is inaction in action. By such a practice and feeling? action loses its binding nature.A man may sit ietly. He may not do anything. But if he has the idea of agency or doership? or if he thinks that he is the doer? he is every doing action? though he is sitting ietly. This is action in inaction. The restless mind will ever be doing actions even though one sits ietly. Actions of the mind are real actions. Nor can anyone even for one moment remain really actionless? for helplessly is everyone driven to action by the alities of Nature. (Chapter III.5)Inaction also induces the feeling of egoism. The inactive man says? I sit ietly I do nothing. Inaction? like action? is wrongly attributed to the Self.He is the performer of all actions who knows this truth. He has attained the end of all actions? i.e.? freedom or knowledge or perfection.When a steamer moves? the trees on the shore which are motionless? appear to move in the opposite direction to a man who is in the steamer. Moving objects that are very far away appear to be stationary or motionless. Even so in the case of the Self inaction is mistaken for action and,action for inaction.The Self is actionless (Akarta or nondoer? Nishkriya or without work). The body and the senses perform action. The actions of the body and the senses are falsely and wrongly attributed by the ignorant to the actionless Self. Therefore the ignorant man thinks? I act. He thinks that the Self is the doer or the agent of the action. This is a mistake. This is ignorance.Just as motion does not really belong to the trees on the shore which appear to move in the opposite direction to a man on board the ship? so also action does not really pertain to the Self.This ignorance which is the cause of birth and death vanishes when you attain Selfrealisaion.",

If you ditch that ego trip, then doing stuff isn't really *doing* anything, it's not gonna keep you stuck. That's inaction *in* action. It's like, you're watching nature do its thing, you're a bystander, you're not the main character. You're one with the universe, and it doesn't matter how much you're doing, it's all chill. That's inaction in action. This whole vibe makes doing stuff not a big deal. But if you're just sitting there, but still thinking 'I'm doing this sitting,' then you're still doing stuff, even if you're not moving. Your mind is going wild, that's action in inaction. Your brain never stops, even when you're chilling. No one can actually *not* do anything, we're all forced to do stuff by nature. Inaction can also make you feel all egotistical. Inactive people are like, 'I'm so chill, I do nothing.' But both action and inaction are wrongly attributed to the self. The person who gets this is the real MVP, they've mastered everything. It's like, a boat moves, and the trees look like they're moving backward. Faraway stuff looks still. It's the same with the self; inaction is mistaken for action, and action for inaction. The self is chill, it doesn't do anything. The body and senses do stuff. People who don't get it think, 'I'm doing this!' They think the self is the one doing it, but that's wrong. It's like, the trees aren't actually moving on the boat, right? Action doesn't belong to the self. This whole misunderstanding is why we're born and die. It disappears when you get self-realization."

They're not attached to any possessions, so no bad karma coming their way.

This is a mistake. From his own point of view and? in truth? he is not an agent at all. He really does no action at all. He feels and says? I do nothing at all. Nature does or the three alities of Nature do everything.He is not affected by heat and cold? pleasure and pain? success and failure? as he always has a balanced state of mind. He is not attached even to the things which are necessary for the bare maintenance of his body. He experiences neither pleasure nor pain? whether or not he obtains food and the other things which are reired for the maintenance of his body.

Verses 4.18-4.23 are all about, like, the results of knowing your true self – it's beyond all that action stuff. If you're vibing with your true self, which is totally action-free, then you're not gonna be stuck in the cycle of life and death, because all that karma stuff is, like, totally burned up by knowing your true self. It's like, a seed that's been burned – it ain't gonna sprout, right? Same with karma – once it's burned up by self-knowledge, it can't create future lives. People might think the sage is still doing stuff, acting all agent-y, but that's totally wrong. From their perspective, they're not doing anything at all. They're like, 'I do nothing, nature does it all.' They're not affected by hot or cold, good or bad, win or lose – they're always balanced. They don't even care about the stuff they need to survive. It's like, they're feeling that ultimate bliss, so they don't even trip about food or anything. They're just vibing in that ultimate reality."

Yogis are, like, *totally* into this, they're sacrificing their breaths, like, one breath at a time. It's all about merging their breaths into this controlled breathing thing. Doing this sacrifice is, like, *super* purifying for your mind and, like, totally destroys all your bad karma."

Your mind's freaking out – goosebumps, big smile. Anger's impulse? Fiery eyes, sweat, lip-biting, body shakes. This verse is saying that controlling desire and anger is the ultimate happiness, way more than, like, a fat bank account, a hot wife, and cute kids. So, yeah, ditch desire and anger – they're total enemies of eternal bliss. Desire is craving something good, something you see, hear about, or remember. Anger is hating something bad, something you see, hear about, or remember. A Yogi? They control that desire/anger impulse, destroy the like/dislike drama, achieve total zen by chilling in their inner self, and are, like, *super* happy. (See also 6.18)"

When a Yogi? by keeping the mind ite steady? by withdrawing it from the objects of the senses? has attachment neither for sensual objects such as sound? nor for the actions (Karmas? Cf. notes to V.13)? knowing that they are of no use to him when he has renounced all thoughts which generate various sorts of desires for the objects of this world and of the next? then he is said to have become a Yogarudha.Do not think of senseobjects. The desires will die by themselves. How can you free yourself from thinking of the objects Think of God or the Self. Then you can avoid thinking of the objects. Then you can free yourself from thinking of the objects of the senses.Renunciation of thoughts implies that all desires and all actions should be renounced? because all desires are born of thoughts. You think first and then act (strive) afterwards to possess the objects of your desire for enjoyment.Whatever a man desires? that he willsAnd whatever he wills? that he does. -- Brihadaranyaka Upanishad? 4.4.5Renunciation of all actions necessarily follows from the renunciation of all desires.O desire I know where thy root lies. Thou art born of Sankalpa (thought). I will not think of thee and thou shalt cease to exist along with the root. -- Mahabharata? Santi Parva? 177.25Indeed desire is born of thought (Sankalpa)? and of thought? Yajnas are born. -- Manu Smriti? II.2",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, when you're totally not obsessed with, like, sensory stuff or, like, doing stuff, and you've, like, let go of all your thoughts? Then, like, you've totally achieved Yoga. It's not about the sensory stuff, fam. The desires will, like, die on their own. How do you stop thinking about stuff? Think about God or your true self. Then you can, like, avoid thinking about the sensory stuff. Letting go of thoughts means letting go of all desires and actions, because, like, thoughts create desires. You think first, then you act to get what you want. If you don't want stuff, you won't do stuff to get it. Desire comes from thoughts. No thoughts, no desires. It's all connected, you know?"

Your lower mind is your enemy because it keeps you trapped, and your higher mind is your friend because it helps you reach enlightenment."

He should renounce all possessions.A householder with Yogic tendencies and spiritual inclination? can practise meditation in a solitary and iet room in his own house or any solitary place on the banks of any holy river (during the holidays or throughout the year if he is a wholetime aspirant or if he has retired from service).The practice must be constant. Only then can one attain Selfrealisation surely and ickly. He who practises meditation by fits and starts and for a few minutes daily will not be able to achieve any tangible results in Yoga. The Yogic aspirant should be free from hope? desire and greed. Only then will he have a steady mind. Hope? desire and greed make the mind ever restless and turbulent. They are the enemies of peace and Selfknowledge. The aspirant should not have many possessions either. He can only keep those articles which are absolutely necessary for the maintenance of his body. If there are many possessions? the mind will be ever thinking of them and attempting to protect them.It you are well established in the practice of Pratyahara? Sama and Dama (withdrawal of the senses? control of mind and the body respectively)? if you have the senses under your full control? you can find perfect solitude and peace even in the most crowded and noisy place of a big city. If the senses are turbulent? if you have not got the power to withdraw them? you will have no peace of mind even in a solitary cave of the Himalayas. A disciplined Yogi who has controlled the senses and the mind can enjoy peace of mind in a solitary cave. A passionate man who has not controlled the senses and the mind will only be building castles in the air if he lives in a solitary cave in a mountain.He who has reduced his wants? who has not a bit of attraction for the world? who has,discrimination and burning aspiration for liberation? and who has observed Mauna (the vow of silence) for months together will be able to live in a cave.You should have perfect control over the body through the regular practice of Yoga Asanas before you take to serious and constant meditation.Aparigraha means noncovetousness? freedom from possessions.The spiritual aspirant need not bother himself about his bodily needs. Everything is provided by God. Everything is prearranged by Mother Nature. She looks after the bodily needs of all very carefully in a more efficient manner than they themselves would do. She knows beter what the reirements are and provides them then and there. Understand the mysterious ways of Mother Nature and become wise. Be grateful to Her for Her unie kindness? grace and mercy.If you want to retire into solitue for the practice of meditation? and if you are a householder with a thirst for intense spiritual Sadhana? you cannot all of a sudden sever your connection with your family. Sudden severance of worldly ties may produce intense mental agony in you and shock in them. You will have to break the ties gradually. Stay for a week or a month in seclusion to begin with. Then gradually prolong the period. They will not feel the pangs of separation from you.As your will has become very weak? as you had no religious discipline or training in schools and colleges when you were young? and as you are under the sway of materialistic influences? it is necessary for you to go in for seclusion for some days or weeks (during the Chritstmas? Easter or other holidays) to practise rigorous Japa and meditation and to develop your willpower.Those who have fixed up their sons in life and who have retired from service? and who have discharged their duties as householders can remain in seclusion for four or five years and practise intense meditation and Tapas (penance) for selfpurification and Selfrealisation. This is like entering a university for higher studies or postgraduate course of study. When the Tapas is over? and when they have attained to Selfknowledge? they should come out and share their knowledge of the Self with others through lectures? conversations? discourses or hearttoheart talks according to their capacity and disposition.How can sensecontrol be tested in a lonely forest where there are no temptations The Yogic student living in a cave should test himself after he has sufficiently advanced? by coming into the society of people. But he should not test himself every now and then like the man who removed the young plant daily after watering it to see whether it had struck deep root or not.",

No hopes, no wants, just pure focus. If you're a total homebody, you can still do this, like, in your room or somewhere peaceful. But it's gotta be consistent, not just a few mins here and there. It's about that self-realization, you know? Hopes and wants are, like, total mind-clutter. They're the enemies of peace and self-knowledge. Keep your stuff minimal, only what you need. If you're all about that Pratyahara, Sama, and Dama (sense withdrawal, mind control, body control), you can find peace anywhere, even in a crowded place. But if you're not in control, even a cave won't help. A disciplined Yogi is chill anywhere. A passionate person who's not in control? They're just daydreaming. If you're all about that minimalist life, zero attachments, and you're serious about liberation, then a cave is your jam. You gotta have control over your body before you meditate. Aparigraha is about not being attached to stuff. God or Mother Nature provides, so don't stress. If you're a family person and want to meditate, don't just cut ties. Do it gradually. If you're weak-willed, take some time to chill and focus on Japa and meditation. If you're retired, you can go full-on hermit mode for years. Then, share your wisdom. How do you test your sense control in the middle of nowhere? After you've leveled up, go back to society. But don't check your progress every second, you know?"

The real Supreme Self is the Atma. This is Primary (Mukhya). Mind also is the self. But this is used in a secondary sense (Gauna). Mukhya Atma is Brahman or the highest Self. Gauna Atma is the mind.Make the mind onepointed by collecting all its dissipated rays by the practice of Yoga. Withdraw it from all senseobjects again and again and try to fix it steadily on your Lakshya or point of meditation or centre. Gradually you will have concentration of the mind or onepointedness. You must be very regular in your practice. Only then will you succeed. Regularity is of paramount importance. You should know the ways and habits of the mind through daily introspection? selfanalysis or selfexamination. You should have a knowledge of the laws of the mind. Then it will be easy for you to check the wandering mind. When you sit for meditation? and when you deliberately attempt to forget the worldly objects? all sorts of worldly thoughts will crop up in your mind and disturb your meditation. You will be ite astonished. Old thoughts that you entertained several years ago? and old memories of past enjoyments will bubble up and force the mind to wander in all directions. You will find that the trapdoor of the vast subconscious mind is opened or the lid of the storehouse of thoughts within is lifted up and the thoughts gush out in a continous stream. The more you attempt to still them? the more they will bubble up with redoubled force and strength.Be not discouraged. Nil desperandum. Never despair. Through regular and constant meditation you can purify the subconscious mind and its constant memories. The fire of meditation will burn all thoughts. Be sure of this. Meditation is a potent antidote to annihilate the poisonous worldly thoughts. Be assured of this.Meditation on the immortal Self will act like a dynamite and blow up all thoughts and memories in the conscious mind. If the thoughts trouble you much? do not try to suppress them by force. Be a silent witness as in a bioscope. They will subside gradually. Then try to root them out through regual silent meditation.During introspection you can clearly observe the rapid shifting of the mind from one line of thought to another. Herein lies a chance for you to mould the mind properly and direct the thoughts and the mental energy in the divine channel. You can rearrange the thoughts and make new associations on a new Sattvic basis. You can throw out wordly and useless thoughts. Just as you remove the weeds and throw them out? you can throw these out? and you can cultivate sublime? divine thoughts in the divine garden of your mind. This is a very patient work. This is a stupendous task indeed. But for a Yogi of determination who has the grace of the Lord and an iron will it is nothing.Calm the bubbling emotions? sentiments? instincts and impulses gradually through silent meditation. You can give a new orientation to your feelings by gradual and systematic practice. You can entirely transmute your wordly nature into divine nature. You can exercise supreme control over the nervecurrents? muscles? the five sheaths (of the Self)? emotions? impulses and instincts through meditation.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, your mind is a total mess, right? It's all over the place. Yoga's the hack to fix that. It's like, you gotta chill, focus on one thing, and control your mind and senses. Find your spot, get comfy, and start your sesh. The goal? A total mind cleanse. It's not just about the mind, though. It's about your *true* self, the Atman, the ultimate vibe. But for now, let's focus on the mind. Yoga's the key to focusing your energy, like, really focusing it. You gotta keep at it, though. Consistency is key. Know your mind's habits, its tricks. Self-reflection is your bestie. When you meditate, all this crazy stuff will pop up—old memories, random thoughts. It's wild. Don't sweat it. Keep going. Meditation is the ultimate mind-cleaner. It's like a bomb that blows up all the bad vibes. If thoughts are stressing you, don't fight them. Just observe them, like you're watching a movie. Then, slowly, through meditation, you'll get rid of them. You can totally reshape your mind, ditch the bad stuff, and cultivate good vibes. It's a long game, but totally worth it. Calm your emotions, control your impulses. Meditation is the ultimate life hack. You can totally transform yourself."

If the body is unsteady? the mind will also become unsteady. There is an intimate connection between the body and the mind.You should not shake the body even a bit. You should attain mastery over the Asana (AsanaJaya) by daily practice. You should be as firm as a statue or a rock. If you keep the body? head and neck erect? the spinal cord also will be erect and the Kundalini will rise up steadily through the subtle nervechannel (Nadi) called the Sushumna. Sit in the lotus pose or the adept pose. This will help you in maintaining the nervous eilibrium and mental poise. You should steadily direct your gaze towards the tip of your nose. This is known as the Nasikagra Drishti. The other gaze is the Bhrumadhya Drishti or gazing between the two eyrows where the psychic centre known as the Ajna Chakra is situated. This is described in chapter V? verse 27. In Bhrumadhya Drishti direct the gaze towards the Ajna Chakra with closed eyes. If you practise this with open eyes? it may produce headache. Foreign particles or dust may fall into the eyes. There may be distraction of the mind also. Do not strain the eyes. Practise gently. When you practise concentration at the tip of the nose you will experience DivyaGandha (various aromas). When you concentrate your gaze at the Ajna Chakra you will experience DivyaJyotis (perception of supraphenomenal lights). This is an experience to give you encouragement? push you up in the spiritual path and convince you of the existence of transcendental or supraphysical things. Do not stop your Sadhana. Yogins and those Bhaktas who meditate on Lord Siva concentrate on the Ajna Chakra with the Bhrumadhya Drishti. You can select whichever Drishti suits you best.Though the gaze is directed towards the tip of the nose when the eyes are halfclosed and the eyalls are steady the mind should be fixed only on the self. Therefore you will have to gaze? as it were? at the tip of the nose. In chapter VI? verse 25? the Lord says Having made the mind abide in the Self? let him not think of anything. Gazing at the tip of the nose will soon bring about concentration of the mind.Whichever be the point selected? visualise your own tutelary deity there and feel His Living Presence.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, the Lord is dropping some serious knowledge on posture and where to focus your gaze for mad meditation skills. No cap, you can't even *try* to chill your mind if your body's all over the place. It's a total vibe check; body and mind are, like, totally connected. You gotta be straight-up *still*, no micro-shakes allowed. Think statue, think rock—that's the goal. Level up your posture game daily, and your spine will be straight fire, boosting that Kundalini energy. Hit the lotus pose or whatever works; it's all about that nervous system equilibrium and mental chill. Now, the gaze: focus on the tip of your nose (Nasikagra Drishti). Another option is the Bhrumadhya Drishti—between your eyebrows, where the Ajna Chakra is at (check chapter 5, verse 27). But, like, keep your eyes closed for that one; open-eye Bhrumadhya Drishti is a headache waiting to happen, plus dust and distractions. No cap, keep it gentle. Focusing on your nose tip will give you some crazy aromas, and the Ajna Chakra will give you some next-level light shows. It's all about that spiritual boost, that proof that the unseen is real. Don't stop your spiritual journey. Yogins and Lord Shiva peeps focus on the Ajna Chakra. Choose your fighter, but keep your mind on yourself. Chapter 6, verse 25 is all about keeping your mind on yourself, and the nose tip gaze helps with that. Pick a spot, visualize your spirit guide, and feel their presence."

The Divine Light can descend only in a serene mind. Serenity is attained by the eradication of Vasanas or desires and cravings. He should be fearless. This is the most important alification. A timid man or a coward is very far from Selfrealisation.A Brahmachari (celibate) should serve his Guru or the spiritual preceptor wholeheartedly and should live on alms. This also constitutes the BrahmachariVrata. The aspirant should control the modifications of the mind. He should be balanced in pleasure and pain? heat and cold? honour and dishonour. He should ever think of the Lord and take Him as the Supreme Goal.Brahmacharya also means continence. Semen or the vital fluid tones the nerves and the brain? and energises the whole system. That Brahmachari who has preserved this vital force by the vow,of celibacy and sublimated it into Ojas Sakti or radiant spiritual power can practise steady meditation for a long period. Only he can ascend the ladder of Yoga. Without Brahmacharya or celibacy not an iota or spiritual progress is possible. Continence is the very foundation on which the superstructure of meditation and Samadhi can be built up.

Think celibacy, total commitment to your guru, living super humbly. It's a whole vibe. You gotta master your mind, control those thoughts. Stay balanced, no matter what – rich or broke, hot or cold, it's all the same. Keep your focus on the Lord, make them your ultimate goal. Brahmacharya is also about conserving your energy, that vital force. It's like, leveling up your spiritual power. It's the foundation for deep meditation and reaching enlightenment.

Some aspirants take asceticism as the goal it is only the means but not the end. The nervous system is extremely,sensitive. It responds even to very slight changes and causes distraction of the mind. It is? therefore? very necessary that you should lead a very regulated and disciplined life and should be moderate in food? sleep and recreation. Take measured food.

If he had not done any great evil action which could overwhelm his Yogic tendencies he will certainly continue his Yogic practices in this birth very vigorously through the force of the Yogic Samskaras created by his Yogic practices in his previous birth.

He will enjoy the eternal bliss and the everlasting peace of the Eternal.An aspirant who is desirous of obtaining Moksha alone is not affected by the sin of nonperformance of action even if he renounces all the obligatory and optional or occasional duties. He goes beyond the word of Brahman (the scripture or the Vedas).When such is the case of an aspirant who is without any spiritual inclinations or Samskaras of the previous birth? how much more exalted will be the state of that student who has done Yogic practices in his previous birth? who has fallen from Yoga in his previous birth? and who has taken up Yoga in this birth? renouncing all the worldly activitiesImpelled by the strong desire for liberation he practises rigorous Sadhana in this birth. He is constrained? as it were? by the force of the good Samskaras of his previous birth to take to Yogic practices in spite of himself.In this verse the Lord lays stress on the fact that no effort in the practice of Yoga goes in vain. Even the smallest effor will have its effect sooner or later in this birth or another. Therefore there is no cause for disappointment even for the dullest type of spiritual aspirant.",

There is the instinct in man to preserve his body. Man wishes to attain those objects which help the preservation of the body. He wishes to get rid of those objects which give pain to the body and the mind. On account of delusion caused by the pairs of opposites? desire and aversion spring up and man cannot get the knowledge of the things as they are? even of this external universe of senseexperience and it needs no saying that in a man whose intellect is overwhelmed by desire and aversion there cannot arise the transcendental knowledge of the innermost Self.Raga (attraction) and Dvesha (repulsion)? pleasure and pain? heat and cold? happiness and misery? joy and sorrow? success and failure? censure and priase? honour and dishonour are the Dvandvas or the pairs of opposites. Desire and aversion (or attraction and repulsion) induce delusion in all beings and serve as obstacles to the dawn of the knowledge of the Self.He whose intellect is obscured by the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites is not able to realise I am the Self. Therefore he does not adore Me as the Self.He who is a victim of RagaDvesha loses the power of discrimination. He wishes that pleasant objects should last for ever and that disagreeable or unpleasant objects should disappear immediately.

Humans are all about self-preservation, tryna keep their bodies alive. We chase after things that help us survive, and ditch anything that causes pain, physically or mentally. This whole desire/aversion thing? It's a total mindf***. It's like, this delusion caused by these pairs of opposites keeps us from seeing reality, even the basic stuff we experience with our senses. And forget about enlightenment – if your mind is all caught up in wanting and hating, you ain't gonna find your inner self. Raga and Dvesha are everywhere: pleasure and pain, hot and cold, happy and sad, winning and losing, praise and hate, clout and no clout – it's all pairs of opposites. Desire and aversion mess with everyone's heads, blocking them from knowing their true selves. If your mind is clouded by these opposites, you can't realize you *are* the Self, and you won't worship me as the Self. People who are all caught up in Raga and Dvesha lose their ability to think clearly. They want good stuff to last forever and bad stuff to disappear instantly. But that's not how it works! Things change, time passes, and what's good now might suck later. Our minds are always changing, wanting something new, getting bored with the same old thing."

Adhibhuta? Adhidaiva and Adhiyajna. Arjuna does not understand the meaning of these terms. So he proceeds to ask the Lord the above estions for their elucidation. Lord Krishna gives the answers succinctly to the above estions in their order.Some treat this chapter as Abhyasa Yoga because in this chapter verses 7? 8? 10? 12? 13 and 14 deal with spiritual practices. Verse 7 treats of Karma and Bhakti Yoga combined (giving the hands to the service of humanity or society and fixing the mind on the Lord). Verse 8 deals with Abhyasa Yoga.

It is the source? root and womb of everything. In It all beings that are manifested live? move and have their very being. Hence? It is Paramam? the Supreme and Akshara.Its essential nature or Svabhava is Adhyatma. Brahmans dwelling in each individual body as the innermost Self (the Pratyagatma) is called Adhyatma. Yajnavalkya (a great sage of the Upanishadic period) said O Gargi Heaven and earth stand upheld in their places. The Brahmanas call this (Brahman) the Akshara (the imperishable). It is neither red nor white It is not shadow? not darkness? nor air? not ehter? without adhesion? without smell? without eyes? without ears? without speech? without mind? without light? without breath? without a mouth or door? without measures? having nothing within and nothing outside It. It does not consume anything? nor does anyone consume It. Akshara is the Supreme Brahman only.Akshara here does not mean the holy word Om? or the Avyakta (the unmanifested source of all that is in Nature). There is Laya (absorption) for Om. There is destruction for the unmanifested Nature also. Therefore Brahman is the Akshara? the Imperishable? the Supreme Being.Offering All virtuous work.The sacrificial act which consists of offering cooked rice? cakes? etc.? to the gods and which causes the genesis and support of beings is called Karma. The oblations in the sacrifice assume a subtle form and reach the sphere of the sun. Through the sun there is rain? and various sorts of grains? vegetables and fruits crop up. The living beings (Bhutas) live and develop on account of rice and other foodstuffs. Therefore Yajnas are the cause of the genesis and support of all beings.",

The most prominent thought of ones life occupies the mind at the time of death. The predominant idea at the time of death is what in normal life has occupied his attention most. The last thought determines the nature or character of the body to be attained next. As a man thinketh? so shall he becometh.The force of Samskaras which one has created by his previous practice is the cause of their remembrance at death. Those who have practised worship of God throughout their life can have remembrance of their tutelary deity at the time of death.The analogy of the wasp and the caterpillar (BhramaraKitaNyaya) can be applied here. The caterpillar constantly remembers the wasp and becomes eventually transformed into a wasp. Even so he who constantly remembers his tutelary deity becomes identical with that deity. Nandikesvara is an example. He constantly thought of his Lord and assumed a form eal to that of the Lord.If you constantly think of the immortal Self during your lifetime? you will entertain the thought of the Self only even at the time of death and will attain immortality. If you always think of your body and identify yourself with the perishable body you will be born again and again. If you think of you pet dog at the time of death you will be born as a dog. Raja Jadabharata thought of his pet deer at the time of his death and so he took the birth of a deer.Every man has a definite outlook on life? definite mode of thinking? definite cravings? desires and hopes? definite character? temperament? taste? disposition and attitude.This is all due to the impressions which have become part and parcel of his subconsciousness. This is all due to experiences which have left their indelible impressions on his mind.He always thinks of his body and physical needs. He searches for his happiness in the external? perishable objects. He identifies himself with the perishable body. He ignores his innermost? allblissful? immortal Self? the source of everything. He trains his body? senses? mind and intellect in worldly pursuits. He ignores the Yogic discipline of the mind and the senses. Therefore he always thinks of his body? bread? drink and clothing. He forgets all about God and the Self? the indweller? an embodiment of bliss and knowledge? fountain of joy and happiness.Desires are endless. Therefore man cannot gratify them in one birth. At the time of death the whole storehouse of impressions and desires is churned out and the most prominent? the strongest and cherished desire comes to the surface of the mind or the field of mental consciousness. This churned up butter or cream (cherished desire) arrests his attention for immediate gratification. He thinks of only that at the time of death. Just as the most vital mango plant shoots up prominently in the nursery? so also the strongest desire shoots up on the surface of the mind. If the desire is not gratified his mind gets saturated with it and it is gratified in his nextbirth. This desire will become very promenent in his next birth.You yourself are the author of your own destiny. You yourself are responsible for your thoughts? character? feelings? actions and experiences. You planted certain worldly desires and Samskaras in your subconscious mind? and allowed them to germinate and grow. If you had planted spiritual aspiration? the desire for liberation and spiritual Samskaras? you would reap the fruit of immortality and eternal bliss. As you sow so shall you reap.He who practises constant and profound meditation on the Self of his own tutelary deity throughout his life will be able to meet death with an unruffled mind. He alone would go to the Supreme? thinking of It at the time of his departure from this world? too. You should have exclusive devotion to God. Your whole mind must be absorbed in Him. You should not allow any outside worldly impressions? wherein there is an iota of selfish desire? to sink into your subconscious mind. Then you can think of the Lord exclusively at the time of death and enter His very Being.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, your last thoughts before you, like, *actually* die? They totally decide what your next life's gonna be. Whatever's been on your mind the most, that's what's gonna stick with you. It's like, the ultimate vibe check before you respawn. It's all about the karmic baggage you've been lugging around. If you've been all about worshipping your fave deity, then boom, you're vibing with them in the afterlife. It's like that wasp-caterpillar thing – the caterpillar's obsessed with the wasp, and guess what? It turns into a wasp! Same thing with you and your deity. If you're all about that immortal self-love, you'll be chilling in eternal bliss. But if you're all about your body and that fleeting clout, you're stuck in the cycle of reincarnation. Think about Raja Jadabharata – dude was obsessed with his deer, and guess what? He became a deer! It's all about your mindset, your whole vibe. Your desires, your hopes, your whole personality – it's all built up from your past experiences. If you're all about the material world, you're gonna be stuck in that loop. But if you're all about spiritual growth, you're gonna level up. It's all about what you focus on. At the end of the day, your last thoughts are like the ultimate save point. If you're all about God, you'll be with God. It's that simple. No cap."

Yama (the God of Death) said to Nachiketas? The goal which all the Vedas speak of? which all penances proclaim and wishing for which they lead the life of celibacy? that goal (world) I will briefly tell thee. It is Om. Satyakama the son of Sibi estioned Pippalada? O Bhagavan? if some one among men meditates here until death on the syllable Om? what world does he obtain by that Pippalada replied? O Satyakama? the syllable Om is indeed the higher and the lower Brahman. He who meditates on the higher Purusha with this syllable Om of three Matras (units) is led up by the Samaverses to the Brahmaloka or the world of Brahma. (Prasnopanishad)Pranava or Om is considered either as an expression of the Supreme Self or Its symbol like anidol (Pratika). It serves persons of dull and middling intellects as a means for realising the Supreme Self.Chant Om three times at the commencement of your meditation you will find concentration of mind easier.",

It's, like, totally what the ancient texts are all about. Even Yama, the OG death dude, spilled the tea to Nachiketas about it. It's the reason peeps do the whole celibacy thing – to unlock that next level. It's also what Satyakama was asking Pippalada about. Basically, Om is the key to unlocking the ultimate reality, whether you're a total noob or a pro. It's like, the cheat code to the universe. Three Om's before you meditate? Yeah, that's the meta."

In order to create dispassion in their minds and a longing for liberation in their hearts? and to remove the fallacious belief that a man reaps the fruits of what he has not done or that he does not reap the fruits of what he has done? the Lord has said that all creatures involuntarily come into being again and again at the coming of the day and dissolve at the coming of the night (on account of the actions or Karmas caused by desire born of ignorance).",

It's like, you're constantly being reborn, reaping what you sow, whether you like it or not. It's a total vibe check, and peeps are totally helpless against it.

That's for the people who do all the rituals and stuff, hoping for a reward. It's not like *everyone* can just choose either path, you know? The bright path is for the devotees, and the dark one is for the ritual peeps. These paths are, like, *forever* things, as long as Samsara is a thing."

It can hardly be described in words. It can be realised only through direct experience or spiritual intuition. Atman or Brahman or the selfluminous? eternal? Supreme Purusha is ever shining in the chambers of the hearts of men. Throughout the ages there have always been a few who have trodden the spiritual path and found out this secret or the spiritual treasure of the precious pearl of the Self. Knowledge of the Self is the only direct means for attaining liberation? Karma Yoga purifies the heart and leads to the dawn of the knowledge of the Self.Lord Krishna says? O Arjuna? I shall teach you this profoundest secret knowledge combined with realisation as you are free from jealousy. From this we can clearly understand that freedom from jealousy is an important alification for an aspirant. Knowledge can only dawn in a mind which is free from all forms of jealousy which causes great distraction of the mind and produces intense heartburning. Matsarya (malicious envy)? Irshya (jealous of others prosperity or happiness) and Asuya (envious or indignant over the merits of another) are all varieties of jealousy. If you superimpose evil alities on a virtuous man who really does not possess these alities on a virtuous man who really does not possess these alities and speak ill of him? this is jealousy (Asuya). To behold evil or to look at a person with the faultfinding evil eye? and to see evil in him who is free from any kind of fault and who is virtuous is Asyua. Jealousy is only pettymindedness. This is a modification of ignorance. It can be eradicated by eniry of the nature of the Self and cultivating its opposite alities? viz.? nobility? broad and universal tolerance? magnanimity and largeheartedness.To thee who does not carp or cavil This implies that Arjuna was endowed with all the virtues of a disciple such as straightforwardness? selfcontrol? restraint of the senses? serenity of mind? discrmination? dispassion? etc. This is the Upalakshana (the truth alluded to where only a part is stated) and Asuya is the Upalakshaka (the hint which alludes to the Upalakshana).",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, this whole 'knowing thyself' thing? It's, like, the ultimate secret, no cap. It's not just book smarts about Brahman (that's *paroksha* brahma jnana, the theory); it's the *vibe*, the *feeling* of it (that's *aparoksha* brahma jnana, the real deal). That's how you escape the endless cycle of suffering, the whole samsara thing. It's, like, the deepest, most real secret ever. It's not something you can just explain; you gotta *experience* it. It's always been there, this inner light, this Atman, this Brahman, this supreme being, shining bright in everyone's heart. Some peeps have found it, you know? It's like finding the ultimate treasure. Knowing yourself is the only way to get free. Karma yoga helps, it cleanses your soul, gets you ready for that self-knowledge. Krishna's saying, 'Arjuna, I'm spilling the tea on this ultimate secret, this knowledge *and* experience, because you're not a hater.' Basically, no jealousy is key. Jealousy is a major vibe killer; it clouds your mind and makes you bitter. There are different types of jealousy, but it all boils down to being petty. It's ignorance. You gotta ditch that negativity and cultivate some major positive vibes—like, be noble, tolerant, generous, and chill. Arjuna was, like, the perfect student; he was straight-up, self-controlled, and had it all together. Krishna's low-key hinting at this, you know?"

The truth? the sovereign,secret (the Self or the Absolute) can be directly realised by intuition or immediate perception. The science of the Absolute is the most splendid of all sciences. It is the science of sciences. Of sciences the highest? of secrets the most profoun? of purifiers the supreme is this. The knowledge of Brahman is the best purifier. It reduces the roots of all Karmas and all the Karmas themselves which have been stored up in the course of many thousands of births? into ashes in the twinkling of an eye. It destroys Avidya along with its effects. An expiatory act (Prayaschitta) cannot destroy all sins. It removes the effect of a single sin? only to some extent. Even if it is removed the effect of that sin remains in a subtle state in the mind and forces him to do sinful acts in his next birth. But the knowledge of the Self destroys ickly all the sins in their gross and subtle states that are accumulated in the course of several thousands of births along with Avidya? their cause. That is the reason why it is a supreme purifier. The causal body of the Jiva is called MulaAvidya (rootignorance). The Avidya or the veil of ignorance that envelops the visible objects of this world is called Sthula Avidya or gross ignorance.The knowledge of the Self is not opposed to Dharma. It is the fruit of all actions done in many births without expectation of fruits. Further? the knowledge of the Absolute can very easily be attained. One may think that this knowledge will perish soon as it is easily obtained? when its effect is exhausted. It is not so. It is imperishable. It is everlasting. It shines for ever by its own Selfeffulgence. He who has tasted this nectar even once becomes immortal. Therefore the knowledge of the Absolute is certainly worth aciring. You will have to strive very hard to attain it anyhow in this birth? as it is very difficult to get a human birth. Strive hard every moment? for life is uncertain and the prize (final liberation) is great.",

It's the GOAT of all sciences, the most epic secret ever, and the ultimate purifier. Brahman knowledge is the best cleanser ever; it wipes out ALL your past life karma – like, poof! – in a sec. It destroys ignorance and its effects. Regular atonement only fixes some sins, leaving subtle bad vibes that haunt you in your next life. But this knowledge? It obliterates *everything*, gross and subtle, from thousands of lifetimes. That's why it's the supreme purifier. MulaAvidya is the root of ignorance, and Sthula Avidya is the surface-level ignorance. This Self-knowledge isn't anti-Dharma; it's the reward for all your good deeds across lifetimes. Plus, it's super easy to get. Don't think it's weak because it's easy; it's *imperishable*, forever shining. Once you taste this nectar, you're immortal. So, yeah, you *gotta* hustle to get it in this life, 'cause human life is rare, and the prize (moksha) is huge. Go get it!"

When ignorance? the cause of this illusion? disappears? the very idea of the existence of these beings also will vanish.In verses 4 and 5 the Lord uses a paradox or an apparent contradiction All beings dwell in Me and yet do not dwell in Me I do not dwell in them. For a thinker there is no real contradiction at all. Just as space contains all beings and yet is not touched by them? so also Para Brahman contains everything and yet is not touched by them. Even Mulaprakriti? the source or womb of this world? is supported by Brahman. Brahman has no support or root. It rests in Its own pristine glory. (Cf.VII.12?24VIII.22)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, everything is vibing in the Supreme Being's chill, unmanifest mode, right? Every single thing exists *because* of the Supreme Being, but the Supreme Being isn't, like, *in* any of it. It's not contained by anything. It's the ultimate source, the big boss, but it's not stuck inside anything. Think of it like space—space contains everything, but it's not *in* any specific thing. It's everywhere and nowhere at once. The Supreme Being is totally beyond all that. It's not limited by anything, it's just... *itself*. It's the ultimate reality, and everything else is just, like, a temporary blip in comparison. It's a paradox, I know, but that's how it is. It's all connected, but also totally separate. It's like, the ultimate flex."

There cannot be any real connection between matter and Spirit. Saakara (an object with form) can have no connection with Nirakara (the formless). How could this be Devoid of attachment It is never attached. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad? III.9.26) Though unattached? It supports all beings It is the efficient or instrumental cause It brings forth all beings but It does not dwell in them? because It is unconnected with any object. This is a great mystery. Just as the dreamer has no connection with the dream object? just as ether or air has no connection with the vessel? so also Brahman has no connection with the objects or the body. The connection between the Self and the physical body is illusory.The Adhishthana or support (Brahman) for the illusory object (Kalpitam) superimposed on,Brahman has no connection whatsoever with the alities or the defects of the objects that are superimposed on the Absolute. The snake is superimposed on a rope. The rope is the support (Adhishthana) for the illusory snake (Kalpitam). This is an example of superimposition or Adhyasa. (Cf.VII.25X.7.XI.8)",

Think of it like a dream—the dreamer isn't *in* the dream. Or air in a container. Brahman's not in the body or anything else. That connection is totally an illusion.

Just as the wind ever rests in the ether (space) without any contact or attachment? so also all beings and objects rest in Brahman without any attachment or contact at all. These objects cannot produce any effect on It.What sort of relationship is there between Brahman and the objects of this universe Is it Samyoga? Samavaya or Tadatmya Sambandha The relationship of the stick with the drum is Samyaoga Sambandha. Let us assume that there is such a Sambandha (relationship or connection). There cannot be connection between all the parts because Brahman is infinite and the elements are finite. You may say that there is connection of the Ekadesa type. This is also not possible? because there can be such relationship only between objects which possess members or parts like the tree and monkey. (Ekadesa is partial). Brahman has no parts.If you say that there is Samavaya Sambandha between Brahman and the objects or the elements? this is also not possible. The relationship between the attribute and the possessors of that attribute is called Samavaya Sambandha. The relationship between an individual Brahmin and the whole Brahmin caste is also Samavaya Sambandha. The relationship between hand and man? between the leg and the man is also Samavaya Sambandha. Such relationship does not exist between Brahman and the objects or the elements.The third kind of relationship? viz.? Tadatmya Sambandha is seen to exist between milk and water? fire and the iron ball. Milk shares its alities of sweetness and whiteness with water. Fire shares its alities of brilliance? heat and redness with the hot iron ball. This too is not possible between Brahman and the objects or the elements? because Brahman is ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute and allfull and perfect whereas the elements are insentient? finite and painful. How can they with ite contrary alities have Tadatmya Sambandha with BrahmanTherefore it can be admitted that the elemtns have only got Kalpita Sambandha (superimposition) with Brahman. That object which is superimposed on the substratum or support exists in name only. It does not exist in reality. Brahman is the support or the substratum for this world of names and forms. World here includes all beings and their three kinds of bodies (physical? mental and causal). Therefore? the elements or the beings in this world are not really rooted in Brahman. They do not really dwell in Brahman. It is all in name only.Vayu also means Sutratman or Hiranyagarbha. Bhuta also means the individual consciousness. Just as the ether in the pot is not distinct from the universal ether before the origin and after the destruction of the pot and even when the pot exists? and it is of the nature of the universal soul is of the nature of Brahman during the three periods of time? past? present and future.Just as all efects exist in a state of nondifference in their material cause before they appear? during their period of existence and after their destruction? so also the individual souls are not different from Brahman before the origin of the various limiting adjuncts like mind? intellect? etc.?,during the period of their existence and after their destruction.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so Krishna is dropping some major knowledge here. He's using this wild analogy to explain the previous verses. It's like, the wind is everywhere, right? But it's also chillin' in space, no cap. Similarly, everything and everyone is vibing in Brahman, but without any, like, *actual* connection. It's not like they're attached or anything. So, what's the tea between Brahman and, like, everything else? Is it a *Samyoga*, *Samavaya*, or *Tadatmya Sambandha* thing? Think of a stick and a drum – that's *Samyoga*. But that doesn't work here because Brahman is infinite, and everything else is not. *Samavaya* is like, an attribute and the thing it's attached to, like your hand and your body. Nope, doesn't fit. *Tadatmya* is like, milk and water – they share some traits. But Brahman is, like, the ultimate GOAT, and everything else is... not. So, the only way to explain it is that everything is, like, superimposed on Brahman. It's all just a vibe, not a real thing. Brahman is the ultimate background, and everything else is just, like, a temporary overlay. It's all temporary, fam. Even Vayu, which is also the Hiranyagarbha, and Bhuta, which is like, your individual consciousness. It's all one big, cosmic flex. It's like, the ether in a pot – it's the same ether before, during, and after the pot exists. Same with individual souls and Brahman – they're not separate, before, during, or after life. It's all connected, but not really connected, you know?"

They're too dense to see I'm the Supreme Being, the ultimate glow-up, all-knowing, pure, immortal, and the real Self of everything. They're trippin', thinking I'm just some regular dude. Smart people get that I'm both lit AF and totally transcendent. I'm everywhere, the whole universe is my vibe. I'm the backbone of everything – the world, your body, mind, energy, senses – and these clowns are like, 'Nah, you ain't real?' I'm everywhere, and they still can't see me? Total L. Their lives are a straight-up tragedy."

It is vain hope because they run after transient objects and miss the Eternal. It is vain action? because it is not performed by them as sacrifice unto the Lord. The Agnihotra (a ritual) and other actions performed by them are fruitless? because they insult the Lord. They are senseless. They have no,discrimination. They have no idea of the eternal Self. They worship their body only. They behold no self beyond the body. They neglect their own Self. They do atrocious crimes and cruel actions. They rob others property and murder people. They partake of the nature of the demons and the undivine beings.The Rakshasa are Tamasic and the Asuras are Rajasic.Prakriti means here Svabhava (ones own nature).They see the external human body only. They have no knowledge of the Self that dwells within the body. They do not behold God in the universe. They life for eating and drinking only.He who entertains hope of getting the rewards of actions through mere Karma alone? without the grace of the Lord is one of empty hope and empty deed. Karmas are insentient. They cannot give rewards independently. The omniscient Lord Who knows the relationship between Karmas and their fruits can dispense them. He who has obtained knowledge from books which do not admit of the existence of the Self and which do not speak of the Self is one of empty knowledge. This will not give any reward. That knowledge obtained through the study of spiritual books which treat of Brahman alone can give the reward. (Cf.VII.15XVI.6?20)",

Zero sacrifice to the Lord, so it's all pointless. Their rituals? They diss the Lord, so, yeah, no rewards. They're clueless, no self-awareness, only worshipping their bodies. They don't see the self beyond the body, total self-neglect. They commit heinous crimes, rob, murder—total demon vibes. Rakshasas are dark, Asuras are ego-driven. It's all about their own messed-up nature. They only see the outside, not the inner self, or God in the universe. It's all about eating and drinking. Hoping for rewards from karma alone, without the Lord's grace? That's delusional. Karma's inanimate, it can't give rewards independently. Only the Lord knows the connection between karma and rewards. Knowledge from books that ignore the Self? That's useless knowledge. Only knowledge of Brahman gives rewards."

I send forth the rain in the form of Indra in the rainy season and I take it back during the rest of the year.Sat Existence? the manifested world (the effect).Asat Nonexistence? the unmanifested (the cause).Nonexistence does not mean nothingness. The subtle? unmanifested cause is spoken of as nonexitence. The Self or Brahman or the Eternal can never be altogether nonexistence. It always exists. It is Existence Absolute. If you say that the subtle unmanifested cause is nothing? it is impossible to conceive existence coming out of nothing. The Chhandogya Upanishad asks? How can existence come out of nonexistence It is simply absurd to conceive that existence has arisen out of nonexistence (nothing).For a Vedantin ( student or follower of Vedanta) Brahman (the Absolute) is Sat (existence) because It always exists and because It is unchanging. This manifested world is Asat or unreal. For the worldlyminded people who have neither understanding nor knowledge of Brahman? who are endowed with gross and impure mind? who do not have a sharp and subtle intellect? and who ca perceive the gross forms only? this manifested world is the Sat and the subtle unmanifested MulaPrakriti (the primordial Nature)? the cause of this manifested world? is Asat. For them Brahman also is Asat. The unmanifested refers to MulaPrakriti and Para Brahman also because both are hidden.Every object has three states? viz.? the gross (Sthula)? the subtle (Sukshma) and the causal (Karana). Mahakarana (the great causeless cause) is Para Brahman. The gross and the subtle states are the effects of Karana. What you see outside is the physical body. This physical body is moved by the astral (the subtle) body made up of the mind? liferoce and the senses. The causal body is the seedbody.

For some peeps, the real world is the real deal, and the unseen stuff is, like, not even a thing. But for others, it's the other way around. It's all about what you're vibing with, you know?

They are irresistibly swept away by the temptation of the higher planes (the heaven? and the plane of the celestial beings? etc.). They lose their power of discrimination and right understanding and thery lose themselves in heavenly enjoyments. The dwellers of the higher planes? the shining ones? tempt the aspirants in a variety of ways. They say unto them? O Yogi? we are very much pleased with your austerities and dispassion? spiritual practices and divine alities. This is the plane for your final resting which you have obtained through your merit and your austerities. We are all your servants to obey your orders and carry out your ?nds or behests. Here is the celestial car for you. You can move about anywhere you like. Here are the celestial damsels to attend on you. They will please you with their celestial music. Here is the wishfulfilling ree which will give you whatever you want. Here is the celestial nectar in the golden cup? which will make you immortal. Here is the celestial lake of supreme joy. You can swim freely in this lake. The uncautious Yogi is easily carried away by the invitations of the gods and the sweet flowery speeches. He gets false satisfaction or contentment. He thinks that he has reached the highest goal of Yoga. He yields to the templations and his energy is dissipated in various directions. As soon as his merits are exhausted he comes down to this earthplane. He will have to start his upward climb on the spiritual lader once more. But that dispassionate Yogi who is endowed with strong discrimination rejects ruthlessly these invitations from the gods? marches boldly on his spiritual path and stops not till he attains the highest rung on the ladder of Yoga or the highest summit on the hill of knowledge or Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He is fully conscious that enjoyments in heaven are as much worthless as those of this illusory world. The pleasures of heaven are subtle? exceedingly intense and extremely intoxicating. That is the reason why the uncautious? nonvigilant and less dispassionate aspirant yields easily to the temptations of the higher planes. Even in this physical plane? in the West and in America where there is abundance of wealth? plenty of dollars and gold? people enjoy subtle and intense sensual pleasures. Every day scientists bring out new inventions? new forms of sensual pleasures for the gratification of the mischievous and revolting senses. Even an abstemious man of simple habits of India becomes a changed man when he lives in America or Europe for some time. He yields to the temptations. Such is the power of Maya. Such is the influence of temptation. Such is the strength of the senses. That man who is endowed with strong discrimination? sustained dispassion? good selfanalytic power? and burning yearning for liberation? can resist temptations and he aloen can be really happy. He alone can attain the highest goal of life? the final beatitude or the sublime vision of the Infinite.Those who drink the Soma juice are purified from sin.Sacrifices Such as the Agnistoma? Jyotistoma. They worship Me as the Vasus and other deities (Rudras and Adityas) by sacrifices such as the Agnistoma.Indra is the Lord of the gods. He is called Satakratu because he had performed a hundred sacrifices. The divine pleasures are the supernatural pleasures of the heaven.DivyaBhoga An enjoyment that is beyond the reach of man or an enjoyment that can be had only by the celestial body of the gods or an enjoyment given by the gods in the heaven. The term Bhoga indicates sensual pleasures. Though the heavenly pleasuresare of a very subtle nature? yet,they are sensual pleasures only. (Cf.II.45)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, imagine you're climbing this crazy mountain of yoga, right? You're almost at the top, but then BAM! You get totally sidetracked by this heavenly paradise. It's like, super tempting, all shiny and sparkly, and you lose your focus. You're all, 'OMG, this is amazing!' and forget about your goals. These heavenly beings are all, 'Yo, Yogi! We're totally vibing with your dedication. This is your final destination, bro. We're your servants, you can do whatever you want, ride this sick chariot, chill with these hot celestial babes, and get whatever you desire from this wish-granting tree. Immortal nectar? Check. Epic lake of joy? Double check.' And you're like, 'Whoa, this is it!' But it's a trap! It's all temporary. Once your good karma runs out, you're back to square one. But then there's the other type of Yogi, the one who's super disciplined and focused. They're not falling for that heavenly BS. They keep pushing until they reach true enlightenment. They know that heavenly pleasures are just as fleeting as earthly ones. It's like, even in America, with all the money and stuff, people are always chasing the next thrill. It's the same in heaven, but even more intense. Only the Yogis with serious self-control and a burning desire for liberation can resist the temptation and achieve true happiness."

The Lord is ite satisfied even with a leaf? a flower? a fruit or water? when it is offered with singleminded devotion and pure heart. Was He not satisfied with the little parched rice from the bundle of Sudama and the small berries offered by Sabari You need not build a golden temple for Him. Build a golden temple in your heart. Enthrone Him there. He wants only your devoted heart. But it is difficult to please Indra. You wll have to offer valuable (material) objects to him.A leaf? a flower of a fruit are merely symbols. The true means of attaining the Lord is pure unflinching devotion. All the objects of the state belong to the king. If the servants of the state offer with devotion some objects to the king he is highly satisfied. Even so all the objects of the whole world belong to Him. Yet? He is highly pleased if you offer even a little thing with devotion.Asnami? literally means eat. The indicative meaning or Lakshana Vritti is accept.",

He's down with whatever, even Sudama's sad, dry rice or Sabari's berries. You don't gotta build some crazy golden temple, just, like, *actually* devote your heart. It's all about that pure devotion, fam. Indra's a whole different story; that dude wants the bling. The leaf, flower, fruit thing? It's all symbolic, you know? It's about that pure, unbreakable devotion. It's like, everything belongs to the Lord, so even a little something with real devotion is majorly appreciated. 'Asnami' means 'eat,' but, like, it's more about accepting the offering, you feel me?"

Then you will be freed from the bondage of Karma. You will have freedom in action. He who tries to live in the spirit of this verse will be able to do selfsurrender unto the Lord. Gradually he ascends the spiritual path step by step. His greedy nature is slowly dissolved now. He always gives. He is not eager to take. His whole life with all its actions? thoughts and feelings? is dedicated to the service of the Lord eventually. He lives for the Lord only. He works for the Lord only. There is not a bit of egoism now. His whole nature is transformed into divinity. When actions are dedicated to the Lord? there is no rirth for you. This is the simplest method of Yoga. Do not waste your time any longer. Take it up from today.All actions? all results and all rewards will go to the Lord. There is no separte living for the individual. Just as the river joins the sea abandoning its own name and form so also the individual soul joins the Supreme Soul giving up his own name and form? his own egoistic desires and egoism. The individual will has become one with the cosmic will.Whatever thou doest of thy own sweet will? whatever thou offerest in sacrifice as enjoined in the scriptures? whatever thou givest -- such things as gold? rice? ghee? clothes? etc.? to the Brahmins and others -- whatever austerity such as the ChandrayanaVrata (to destroy sin)? control of the senses? etc.? thou doest? do thou all these as an offering unto Me. (Cf.V.32XII.6and8)Now listen to what you will gain by doing thus.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Bro, like, consecrate everything to the Lord. Then, you're totally free from the karma-jail. Do your thing, no sweat. If you live by this verse, you'll be all about surrendering to the man upstairs. You'll level up spiritually, step by step. Your greed fades, you're all about giving, not taking. Your whole life – actions, thoughts, feelings – is all about serving the Lord. You're living for Him, working for Him, zero ego. You're transformed, totally divine. When you dedicate your actions, there's no rebirth drama. It's the easiest yoga ever. Don't waste time, start today. All actions, results, rewards go to the Lord. No separate existence, you're one with the Supreme. Like a river merging with the ocean, losing its name and form, your soul merges with the Supreme Soul, dropping the ego. Your will becomes one with the cosmic will. Whatever you do, whatever you sacrifice (like, according to the scriptures), whatever you give (gold, rice, ghee, clothes, whatever) to Brahmins and others, whatever austerities you do (like ChandrayanaVrata, controlling your senses), do it all as an offering to Me."

Commentary Intellect is the power which the Antahkarana (the fourfold inner instrument -- the mind? the subconscious mind? intellect and egoism) has of understanding subtle objects.

Pain or discomfort from severe cold? heat? too much rain? thunder? and lightning is Adhidaivika pain. Pain from scorpionsting? snakite? and wild animals is Adhibhautika pain.Satyam or truth is veracity. It is speaking of ones own actual or real experience of things as actually heard or seen. There is not the least twisting or exaggeration or the slightest modification of facts. Dama or selfrestraint is control of the external senses. It is withdrawal of the senses (ear? skin? eyes? tongue and nose) from their respective objects (viz.? sound? touch? form? palatable foods and fragrance). Sama is calmness or tranillity of the mind produced by checking the mind from thinking of external objects of the senses and by disconnecting it from the senses.Sukham Happiness. That which has Dharma or virtue as its chief cause and that which is favourable to all beings? is happiness. Duhkham That which has Adhrama as its cause and that which is unfavourable to all beings? is pain.That which appears is Bhavah. Sat is Bhavah. Asat or unreality is Abhavah.",

The strength of the body and the senses is reduced through fasting.Danam is beneficence.

Samata is that chill vibe where you're not all up in arms about getting good stuff or bad stuff. It's about not freaking out over the good or being bummed about the bad. Tushtih? That's being content, straight-up satisfied with what you got, no matter what. It's like, you're good with your current situation, no greed, total peace of mind. Tapas? That's self-discipline, like fasting and cutting back on food to level up your mind and body. Danam is all about giving back—sharing what you have with others, especially those who can't pay you back. Yasas is the clout you get from doing good, and Ayasas is the opposite—the hate you get from doing bad. All these vibes come from me, the ultimate GOAT."

The Manus are the mindborn sons of God. These creatures which consist of the moving and the unmoving beings are born of the seven great sages and the four Manus. The great sages were original teaches of BrahmaVidya or the ancient wisdom of the Upanishads. The Manus were the rulers of men.

This gross universe with the moving and the unmoving beings and the subtle inner world have come out of the above seven principles. In mythology or the Puranic terminology these seven principles have been symbolised and give human names. Bhrigu? Marichi? Atri? Pulastya? Pulaha? Kratu and Vasishtha are the seven great sages.In the microcosm? Manas (mind)? Buddhi (intellect)? Chitta (subconsciousness) and Ahamkara (egoism) have been symbolised as the four Manus and given human names. The first group forms the base of the macrocosm.

These peeps were all totally vibing with me, so they got, like, super powers and wisdom. The four Kumaras? Total celibates, no kids, just straight-up BrahmaVichara meditation. They were all mind-born, not, like, born from a womb or anything. Manavah, aka humans, are Manu's kids. Manus are, like, God's mind-born sons. All the creatures, moving and non-moving, came from these seven sages and four Manus. The sages were the original teachers of BrahmaVidya, the ancient wisdom. Manus were the rulers, setting the rules and laws. The seven sages also represent seven planes – in the macrocosm, that's Mahat, cosmic Buddhi, Ahamkara, and the five Tanmatras (which become earth, water, fire, air, and ether). The whole universe, both seen and unseen, comes from these seven principles. In mythology, they're given names like Bhrigu, Marichi, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, and Vasishtha. In the microcosm (us!), Manas, Buddhi, Chitta, and Ahamkara are like the four Manus. The first group is the base of the macrocosm, the second is the base of the microcosm. Together, they make up this whole universe of life. Madbhava means they're all about that Me life, totally my vibe."

From the ant to the Creator there is nothing except the Lord.

He lives in the Eternal and is endowed with the highest knowledge of the Self. He who has realised this Truth is free from the superiority and inferiority complexes. There i real awakening of wisdom in him. He will behold the Lord in all beings and all beings in the Lord. He will never hate any creature on this earth. This is a rare living cosmic experience. The Yogi realises that the Lord and His manifestations are one. He attains the supreme goal and is absorbed in Him through his wholehearted devotion. He is perfectly aware of his oneness with the Supreme by My divine Yoga.He can keep his balance of mind now in whatever environments and circumstances he is placed and can do any action without losing his consciousness of oneness or identity with the Supreme Self.

You'll be living eternally, with ultimate self-knowledge. No more feeling superior or inferior, you'll be woke AF. You'll see the Lord in everything and everything in the Lord. Zero hate for any living thing. It's a total mind-blowing cosmic experience. The Yogi gets that the Lord and his forms are one. They reach the ultimate goal, totally absorbed in the Lord through devotion. They're 100% aware of their oneness with the Supreme Being through divine Yoga. They stay chill no matter what, and can do anything without losing that connection. It's like, total zen master vibes."

Commentary Waves originate in water? depend on water and dissolve in water. The only support for the waves is water. Even so the only support for the whole world is the Lord. Realising this? feeling the omnipresence of the Lord? the wise worship Him with devotion and affection in all places. The Supreme is the same in all countries and at all times.

He gazes at His Sakti (creative power) and the whole world evolves and the forms move. The worldly man who has neither sharp nor subtle intellect beholds the changing forms only through the fleshly eyes. He has no idea of the Indwelling Presence? the substratum? the allpervading intelligence or the blissful consciousness. He is allured by the passing forms. He fixes his hopes and joy on these transitory forms. He lives and exerts for them. He rejoices when he gets a wife and children. If these forms pass away he is drowned in sorrow. But the wise ones constantly dwell in the Supreme? the source and the life of all? and enjoy the eternal bliss of the immortal? inner Self? their own nondual Atman? albeit all these forms around them change and pass away. They are steadfast in Yoga. They are endowed with unshakable Yoga. They are enthroned in Yoga. They worship the Supreme in contemplation and enjoy the indescribable bliss of Nirvikalpa Samadhi.Para Brahman? known as Vaasudeva? is the source of the whole world. From Him alone evolves the whole world with all its changes? viz.? existence (Sthiti)? destruction (Nasa)? action (Kriya)? fruit (Phala) and enjoyment (Bhoga). Understanding thus? the wise adore the Supreme Being and engage themselves in profound meditation on the Absolute. (Cf.IX.10)",

He's the OG, the source code. He's the big boss who makes everything happen. Regular people only see the surface stuff, the fleeting trends, and get all caught up in it. They're obsessed with relationships and stuff, and when things don't go their way, they're totally bummed. But wise people? They're chill. They're connected to the source, to the eternal, and they're vibing with that ultimate bliss. They're all about that inner peace, no matter what's happening around them. They're totally in tune with the universe, meditating hard, and experiencing that ultimate high. Vasudeva is the ultimate source, the one who creates, destroys, and makes everything happen. Smart people get this and worship the ultimate being, meditating hard on the absolute truth."

Or, another way to look at it: I'm the Supreme Being, the ultimate snatcher, 'cause I wipe everything out during the cosmic reset. I'm the source of all future beings, the prosperity plug, and the way to get that prosperity for those who are worthy. Beauty? That's Sri. Glow-up? Also Sri. I'm fame, the queen of all the feminine vibes. People who get a little clout think they're huge, total big shots. I'm speech, the fire that keeps justice lit. I'm memory, the nostalgia trip of past good times. Medha? That's the brainpower to keep the scriptures straight. Dhriti? That's the chill to keep your body and senses on lock, even when things get rough. It's also about staying unbothered while you're crushing it. Kshama? That's about endurance, staying in the game. Fame, fortune, memory, smarts, and that unshakeable chill? Those are Daksha's daughters, married to Dharma, so they're all Dharmapatnis."

Thou hast dispelled this delusion of ignorance from me.The vision of the Cosmic Form is not the ultimate goal. If that were so? the Gita would have ended with this chapter. The vision of the Cosmic Form is also one more in a series of graded experiences. It is a terrible experience too. That is the reason why Arjuna said to the Lord? stammering with fear What an awful form Thou hast I have seen that which none hath seen before. My heart is glad? yet faileth me on account of fear. Show me? O God? Thine other form again. O God of gods? support of all the worlds? let me see Thy form with the diadem? and with the mace and discus in Thy hands. Again I wish to see Thee as before assume Thy fourarmed form? O Lord of thousand arms and of forms innumerable.Arjuna heard the Lords statement? viz.? Having pervaded this whole universe with one fragment of Myself? I remain. This induced him to have the vision of the Lords Cosmic Form. He says? O Lord of compassion? Thou hast taught me the spiritual wisdom which can hardly be found in the Vedas. Thou hast saved me. My delusion has disappeared. Thou hast disclosed to me the nature of the Supreme Self? the secrets of Nature and Thy divine glories.

I was all, 'I'm the one doing the killing!' But that's gone now, thanks to your super-deep wisdom. Seeing the Cosmic Form isn't the end goal, though. It's a major trip, a *wild* experience. That's why Arjuna's freaking out, like, 'Dude, that form was terrifying! Show me your normal form again!' Arjuna heard the Lord say he's everywhere, and *bam*, he wants to see the Cosmic Form. He's like, 'You taught me stuff even the Vedas don't have! You saved me! My confusion is gone! Show me your full Cosmic Form!'"

        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Bro, like, the Lord is the ultimate GOAT. He's, like, way more powerful than anyone else, and he's totally indestructible. So, obvi, he's the one you gotta worship, love, and vibe with. 'Sat' is what's been around forever, like, Brahman. 'Asat' is what's not, like, this world and our bodies. 'Sat' and 'Asat' are, like, the manifested and unmanifested stuff that's connected to the indestructible thing. But the indestructible thing is way beyond all that. Sometimes, 'indestructible' means the unmanifested stuff, sometimes it means the Supreme Being. Ananta is, like, totally free from all the limitations of time, space, and stuff. Arjuna is, like, totally praising the Lord here."

Brahma's Kasyapa's grandpa (Pitamaha), but the real OG, Isvara, is Brahma's dad—the great-grandpa. Isvara's got Maya, his chill vibe, his causal body. Isvara's everywhere and nowhere.

In Bhakti Yoga the devotee establishes a near and dear relationship with the Lord. He cultivates slowly and one of the five Bhavas (attitudes) according to his temperament? taste and capacity. The five attitudes are the Santa Bhava (the attitutde of peaceful adoration) Dasya Bhava (the attitude of servant towards the master) Sakhya Bhava (the attitude of a friend) Vatsalya Bhava (the attitude of a parent to the child) and Madhurya Bhava (the attitutde of the lover towards the beloved). The devotee adopts these attitudes towards the Lord. The last (Madhurya Bhava) is the culmination of devotion. It is merging or absorption in the Lord.The devotee adores the Lord. He constantly remembers Him (Smarana). He sings His Name (Kirtana). He speaks of His glories. He repeats His Name. He chants His Mantra (Japa). He prays and prostrates himself. He hears His Lilas (divine plays). He does total? ungrudging and unconditional selfsurrender? obtains His grace? hols communion wih? and eventually gets absorbed in Him.The devotee begins by worshipping the idols or the symbols of God. Then he performs internal worship of the Form. Ultimately he is led to the supreme worship of the allpervading Brahman (Para Puja).Thus As declared in the last verse of the previous chapter.Avyaktam The unmanifested? i.e.? incomprehensible to the senses? transcending all limiting adjuncts. The unmanifested Brahman is beyond all limitations. That which is visible to the senses is called Vyakta or manifest.The hearts of the devotees are wholly fixed on Thee. They worship Thee with all their heart and soul.There are others who worship the unmanifested Brahman which is beyond time? space and causation? which is attributeless? which is eternal and indefinable? which is beyond the reach of speech and mind. These are the wise sages.Of these two? the devotees and the men of knowledge -- who are the better knowers of Yoga (Cf.XI.55)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so this chapter is all about proving that Bhakti Yoga, which is like, totally devoted worship, is way easier than Jnana Yoga, which is all about knowledge. With Bhakti Yoga, you're vibing with the Lord, building a super close relationship. You're cultivating these five different vibes, depending on what you're feeling: Santa Bhava (peaceful chill), Dasya Bhava (servant mode), Sakhya Bhava (BFFs), Vatsalya Bhava (parent-child love), and Madhurya Bhava (romantic love). The ultimate goal is Madhurya Bhava—total merging with the Lord. You're showing love by remembering them, singing their praises, spreading the word, chanting mantras, praying, doing prostrations, listening to their stories, and basically surrendering your whole life. You start with idols or symbols, then you move to internal worship, and finally, you reach the ultimate worship of Brahman. Avyaktam, the unmanifested, is like, the ultimate mystery, beyond our senses. Devotees are all about the Lord, worshipping them with their whole hearts. Then there are the peeps who worship the unmanifested Brahman—the wise sages. So, who's better at Yoga? The devotees or the knowledge peeps?"

Why can It not be defined Because It is unmanifested. It does not have the four alities of manifested beings? vi.z? Jati (caste such as Brahmana? Kshatriya? etc.)? Guna (attributes such as blueness? whiteness? tallness? shortness? etc.)? Kriya (reading? walking? etc.)? and Sambandha (like the relation between father and son).The unmanifest Incomprehensible by any of the organs of knowledge not manifest to any of the organs of knowledge.Upasana (worship) means sitting near. It is approaching the chosen ideal or object of worship by meditating on it? in accordance with the teachings of the scriptures and the spiritual preceptor? and dwelling steadily in the current of that one thought like a threat of oil poured from one vessel to another. It means continous and uninterrupted contemplation of God.The imperishable Brahman is omnipresent? pervading everything like the ether. It is unthinkable? because It is unmanifest. Whatever is visible to the senses can be thought of by the mind also. That which can be grasped by the organs of knowledge can be thought of by the mind also. But the Supreme Being is invisible to the senses and so cannot be grasped by the organs of knowledge and is? therefore? unthinkable. All thoughts of God ultimately lead the aspirant to iescent meditation.It is Kutastha (unchangeable). Kutastha means remaining like a mass or a heap. Therefore It is immutable and eternal. Just as the anvil remains unchanged though the ironpieces which are beaten on the anvil change their shape? so also Brahman is unchanging though the forms are changing. Hence Brahman is called Kutastha. Kuta also means a thing which appears to be good externally but which is full of evil within. Hence it refers to that seed of Samsara? viz.? ignorance? which is full of evil within and which is known as the Avyakrita (undifferentiated) in the Svetasvataropanishad (Mayam tu prakritim vidyat? Mayinam tu mahesvaram) and in the Gita (Mama maya duratyaya  -- The illusion of Mine is hard to pierce -- VII.14). Another interpretation for Kutastha is that which is at the root of everything. He Who is seated in Maya as its witness? as its Lord? is Kutastha.Achalam Immovable? that which is free from change. Therefore the imperishable Brahman is Dhruvam? eternal. (Cf.VIII.21)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, 'Anirdesyam' is, like, totally undefinable, you know? It's, like, beyond words and your brain can't even wrap itself around it. Why? Because it's unmanifested, it doesn't have, like, a caste, attributes, actions, or relationships. It's, like, totally incomprehensible. 'Upasana,' worship? Nah, it's more like, chilling with the divine, meditating on it, vibing with the scriptures and your guru, and, like, totally focusing on that one thought, you know? It's all about that constant, uninterrupted God-contemplation. The imperishable Brahman is everywhere, like, totally omnipresent, like the ether. It's unthinkable because it's unmanifested. Anything you can see or sense, you can think about, right? But the Supreme Being is, like, invisible and intangible, so it's, like, totally unthinkable. Thinking about God leads to, like, the ultimate chill meditation sesh. 'Kutastha' means unchanging, like, totally immutable and eternal. Think of an anvil—it stays the same, even though the iron changes shape, right? Brahman is like that. 'Kuta' can also mean something that looks good on the outside but is, like, totally messed up inside, like, the seed of samsara, that ignorance thing. Another meaning is, like, the root of everything. The one who's, like, witnessing and ruling Maya is 'Kutastha.' 'Achalam' means immovable, unchanging. So, Brahman is 'Dhruvam,' eternal, for sure."

So, you gotta chill the desire, get some self-awareness, and boom—total peace. Letting go of the rewards is the ultimate cleanse for your soul.

These eight verses are called Amritashtakam.The devotee who is established in God bears illwill to none. He looks on all with love and great compassion. He regards all beings as himself. He does not hate even a single being? not even the creature which gives him intense pain. He who entertains mercy towards suffering people and tries to relieve their sufferings is a man of Karuna. He puts himself in the position of the sufferer and feels the pain himself. Mercy is a divine attribute. God is allmerciful. If you wish to hold communion with the Lord? and if you desire to attain Godhead? you must also become allmerciful.The perfect devotee offers full security of life (Abhayadana) to all beings. He is a Paramahamsa Sannyasi. The devotee only can really understand the mysterious ways of the Lord. He beholds the Lord everywhere. He sees the Lord in all creatures. That is the reason why he has eal vision. He is like the sun or the river. The sun sheds its light eally on a palace or a cottage. Anyone can drink the water of a river. A river enches the thirst of cows as well as tigers and lions. The idea of mineness and Iness never arises in the devotees mind. He has no sense of mine and thine. He is indifferent to pleasure and pain. He is not attached to pleasant objects. He does not hate the objects that give him pain. He is as forgiving as the earth. He is not affected a bit when anybody insults? abuses or beats him.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so Krishna's dropping some serious knowledge here about what it means to be a total boss-level devotee. He's laying down eight verses, the \"Amritashtakam,\" that are straight fire. Basically, if you're all about the divine, you ain't hating on anyone. You're vibing with everyone, showing mad compassion, and seeing yourself in everyone. It's not just about not hating; it's about not hating *anyone*, even the peeps who are totally messing with you. Karuna? That's like, next-level empathy—you feel their pain as if it's your own. Mercy is a total godly flex, and if you wanna connect with the Divine, you gotta be all about that mercy. A true devotee is giving everyone total life security—they're like, the ultimate chill guru. Only a devotee can really get the Lord's mysterious ways. They see the Lord everywhere, in every creature, which is why they're so lit. They're like the sun or a river—giving to everyone equally. No 'mine' or 'thine' drama, no attachment to good or bad vibes. They're forgiving AF, like, totally unbothered by hate or drama. They're basically the chillest person ever."

Like the ocean which is ever full? his heart is ever full as he has no cravings. He is ever cheerful and joyous. He has a feeling of fullness whether or not he gets the means for the bare sustencance of his body. He is satisfied with a little thing and he does not care whether it is good or not. He never grumbles? complains or murmurs when he does not obtain food and clothing which are necessary for the maintenance of the body. His mind is ever filled with Me through constant and steady meditation.Yogi He who has evenness of mind always. He has controlled all the senses and desires.

In this chapter, Krishna discriminates between the physical body and the immortal soul. He explains that the physical body is temporary and perishable whereas the soul is permanent and eternal. The physical body can be destroyed but the soul can never be destroyed. The chapter then describes God, who is the Supreme Soul. All the individual souls have originated from the Supreme Soul.

It transforms itself into the body? senses and the sensual objects to serve the two purposes of the individual soul? viz.? Bhoga (enjoyment) and Apavarga (liberation).The Gita is divided into three sections illustrative of the three words of the Mahavakya or Great Sentence of the Sama Veda -- TatTvamAsi (That thou art). In accordance with this view the first six chapters deal with the path of action or Karma Yoga and the nature of the thou (TvamPada). The next six chapters explain the path of devotion or Bhakti Yoga and the nature of That (TatPada). The last six chapters treat of the path of knowledge or Jnana Yoga and the nature of the middle term art (AsiPada) which establishes the identity of the individual and the Supreme Soul (Jiva Brahma Aikyam).Arjuna now wishes to know in detail the difference between Prakriti and Purusha (Matter and Spirit). He desires to have a discriminative knowledge of the difference between them.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "No cap, some books straight-up ditch this verse, making the Gita 700 verses instead of 701. Some peeps think it's fake news, added later. But this section is where things get *real* detailed. It's all about the field (matter) and figuring out what's up with the dude who owns both the lower and higher natures (like, from chapter 7, verses 4 and 5). Before, it was all about the peeps who are besties with the Lord. Now, it's like, 'Okay, what knowledge do *they* need?' This section answers that. Nature's all about those three gunas (qualities), transforming into bodies, senses, and stuff to help the soul get its bhoga (enjoyment) and apavarga (liberation). The whole Gita is like, three parts based on that 'Tat Tvam Asi' thing (That thou art). First six chapters? Karma Yoga, all about 'thou.' Next six? Bhakti Yoga, all about 'That.' Last six? Jnana Yoga, connecting the 'thou' and 'That,' showing how the individual soul and the Supreme Soul are one. Arjuna's low-key asking for the tea on the difference between matter and spirit, like, the real deets on how to tell them apart."

The individual souls (Jivatmas) are different but the Supreme Soul (Paramatma) is one. Wherever there is mind? there are lifreath? egoism and the individual consciousness or reflected intelligence side by side. He who has the sense of duality will take birth again and again. This delusion of dulaity can only be removed by knowledge of the identity of the individual soul and the Absolute. I am happy? I am miserable? I am the doer of this action? and I am the enjoyer of this experience -- these are the experiences of all human beings. Therefore the individual soul is bound to Samsara and is subject to pleasure and pain? and the individual souls are in different bodies. But? the Supreme Soul is free from pleasure and pain. It is not bound to Samsara. It is eternally free. It is one without a second.If there is only one individual soul in all bodies? all should have the same experience at the same time. If Rama suffers from abdominal colic? Krishna also should experience the pain at the same time. If John experiences joy? Jacob also should have a similar experience. If Choudhury is stung by a scorpion? Banerjee also should suffer from the pain. But this is not the case. When Rama suffers? Krishna rejoices. When John is jubilan? Jacob is depressed. When Choudhury suffers from the sting of a scorpion? Banerjee is enjoying his breakfast. Fields are different? bodies are different? minds are different and the individual souls are different from each other. But the knower in all these fields is one. Pleasure and pain are the Dharmas (functions) of the mind only. The individual soul is in essence identical with the Supreme Soul.The knower of the field or the Self is not affected by pleasure and pain? virtue and vice. He is the silent witness only. Pleasure and pain are the functions of the mind. They are ascribed to the Self through ignorance. The ignorant man regards the physical body as the Self. He is swayed by the two currents of likes and dislikes? he does virtuous and vicious actions and reaps the fruits of these actions? viz.? pleasure and pain? and takes birth again and again. But the sage who knows that the Kshetrajna or the knower of the field or the Self is distinct from the body is not swayed by likes and dislikes. He identifies himself with the pure? eternal? Absolute or the Supreme Self and is always happy and actionless? though he performs actions for the welfare of humanity.The disease of Timira (partial blindness) which causes perception of what is contrary to truth pertains to the eye but not to the man who perceives. If the disease is removed by proper treatment he perceives things in their true light. Even so ignorance? doubt? pleasure and pain? virtue and vice? likes and dislikes? false perceptions as well as their cause belong to the instrument (the mind) but not to the silent witness? the knower of the field? the Self.In the state of liberation wherein there is annihilation of the mind? there is no ignorance and the play of the two currents of likes and dislikes does not exist there. If false perception? ignorance? pleasure and pain? doubt? bondage? delusion? sorrow? etc.? were the essential properties of the Self? just as heat is the essential property of fire? they could not be got rid of at any time. But there have been sages of Selfrealisation in the past like Sankara? Dattatreya? Jada Bharata and Yajnavalkya who possessed extraordinary supersensual or intuitional knowledge? who were free from false perception? doubt? fear? delusion? sorrow? etc. They were not conscious of Samsara but they had perfect awareness of the Self. Therefore? we will have to conclude that the Self is ever free? pure? perfect? eternal and that ignorance inheres in the instrument (the mind) and not in the Self.Ignorance born of Tamas acts as a veil and prevents man from knowing his essential nature as,the ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute. It causes perception of what is ite the contrary of truth and causes doubt or nonperception of truth. As soon as knowledge of the Self dawns these three forms of ignorance vanish in toto. Therefore these three forms of ignorance are not the attributes of the Self. They belong to the mind? the organ or the instrument. Mind is only an effect or a product of ignorance.The wheel of Samsara or the worldprocess rotates on account of ignorance. It exists only for the ignorant man who perceives the world as it appears to him.There is no Samsara for a liberated sage. Any disease of the eye cannot in any way effect the sun (the dity presiding over the eye). The breaking of the pot will not in any way affect the ether or space in the pot. The water of the mirage cannot render the earth moist. Even so ignorance and its effecs cannot in the least affect the pure? subtle? attributeless? formless? limbless? partless and selfluminous Kshetrajna or the Self. Ignorance does not touch the Self. (Cf.X.20XIII.32XVIII.61)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, the fields are all different, but the person *knowing* the fields is the same one. It's like, all the individual souls are different, but the Supreme Soul is, like, *one*. Wherever there's a mind, there's life, ego, and that individual consciousness thing. If you're stuck on this whole duality thing, you're gonna be reborn again and again. The only way to escape this loop is to, like, *know* that the individual soul and the Absolute are the same. We all go through that 'I'm happy, I'm sad, I did that, that's my experience' stuff. That's why individual souls are stuck in this cycle of pleasure and pain, in different bodies. But the Supreme Soul? Nah, it's chill. No pleasure, no pain, no Samsara. It's just *one*. If there was only one soul in all bodies, everyone would feel the same thing at the same time. If Rama has a stomach ache, Krishna would feel it too. If John's happy, Jacob would be too. If Choudhury gets stung by a scorpion, Banerjee would feel it. But that's not how it works, right? When Rama's hurting, Krishna's vibing. When John's lit, Jacob's down. When Choudhury's getting stung, Banerjee's eating breakfast. The fields are different, the bodies are different, the minds are different, and the individual souls are different. But the *knower* of all these fields? That's the same one. Pleasure and pain are just mind stuff. The individual soul is basically the same as the Supreme Soul. The knower, the Self, doesn't get affected by pleasure or pain, good or bad. It's just a silent observer. Pleasure and pain are mind things. People think their body *is* the Self, so they get caught up in likes and dislikes, do good and bad stuff, get the results, and get reborn. But a wise person knows the Kshetrajna, the knower, the Self, is different from the body. They don't get caught up in likes and dislikes. They're one with the pure, eternal, Absolute, Supreme Self. They're always happy and chill, even if they're doing stuff for people. It's like, Timira, that eye disease that makes you see stuff wrong, is in the eye, not the person seeing. Fix the eye, and you see clearly. Ignorance, doubt, pleasure, pain, good, bad, likes, dislikes, and all that stuff are in the mind, not in the silent witness, the Self. When you're liberated, your mind's gone, so there's no ignorance, no likes and dislikes. If false perceptions, ignorance, pleasure, pain, doubt, and all that were part of the Self, like heat is part of fire, you could never get rid of them. But there have been enlightened people, like Sankara, Dattatreya, Jada Bharata, and Yajnavalkya, who were totally free from all that stuff. They weren't stuck in Samsara, but they knew the Self. So, the Self is always free, pure, perfect, and eternal. Ignorance is in the mind, not the Self. Ignorance from Tamas is like a veil, stopping you from knowing your true self, the Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. It makes you see things wrong and creates doubt. When you know the Self, that ignorance disappears. So, that ignorance isn't part of the Self; it's in the mind. The mind is just a product of ignorance. Samsara, the cycle of life, is all because of ignorance. It only exists for people who see the world as it seems. For a liberated person, there's no Samsara. An eye disease doesn't affect the sun. Breaking a pot doesn't affect the space inside. Mirage water doesn't make the earth wet. Ignorance and its effects don't affect the pure, subtle, attributeless, formless, limbless, partless, self-luminous Kshetrajna, the Self. Ignorance doesn't touch the Self."

O Arjuna? what the field is? why the body is called the field? what are its modifications or changes in other words what transformations it undergoes? what are its properties? what effects arise in it from what causes? to whom it belongs? whether it is cultivated or whether it grows wild.That field refers to the field mentioned in verse 1.Who He is Who is that knower of the field What are His powers (Prabhavas are powers such as the power of seeing? hearing? etc.) which originate from the limiting adjuncts (such as the eys? the ears? etc.) Do thou hear My speech which describes succinctly the real nature of the field and the knower of the field in all these specific aspects.O Arjuna? I am ite sure that thou wilt clearly comprehend the truth on hearing My speech.The body is the field. The ten senses represent the ten bulls. The bulls work unceasingly day and night through the field of the objects of the senses. The mind is the supervisor. The individual soul is the tenant. The five vital airs (Pranas) are the five labourers. The Primordial Nature is the mistress of the field. This field is Her property. She Herself watches over the field vigilantly. She is endowed with the three alities. Rajas sows the seed Sattva guards it Tamas reaps the harvest. On the threshing floor or MahatTattva (the cosmic mind) with the help of the ox called time? She -- Primordial Nature -- thrashes out the corn. If the individual soul does evil actions? it sows the seeds of sin? manures with evil? reaps a crop of sin? and undergoes the pains of Samsara? viz.? birth? decay? old age? sickness? and the three kinds of afflictions. If it does virtuous actions it sows the good seeds of virtue and reaps a crop of happiness.Lord Krishna now speaks very highly in the following verse of the true nature of the field and the knower of the field in order to create interest in the hearer.",

The function of the intellect is determination. Buddhi is the faculty of determination. The cause of the intellect is the Unmanifested (which is the undifferentiated energy of the Lord). (Cf.VII.14 Daivi hyesha gunamayi mama maya duratyaya  -- This divine illusion of Mine? caused by the alities? is difficult to cross over.) The above Nature is divided eightfold (Cf.VII.4).The ten senses are the five organs of knowledge (ears? skin? eyes? tongue and nose)? so called because they enable the mind to get knowledge of the external world? and the five organs of action (hands? feet? mouth? anus and the generative organ)? so called because they perform actions.The one This is the mind. This is the eleventh sense whose function is thinking and doubting (Sankalpa and Vikalpa).The five objects of the senses are sound? touch? form (colour)? taste and smell. These are the fivefol pastures of the senses.All the great elements? egoism? intellect? the senses and mind are all absorbed in the Unmanifested at the time of the cosmic dissolution.Mind is Maya. Mind is Avidya (ignorance). Mind is at the root of all activities. It gives strength to desires? fosters fear and builds castles in the air. It confers force on egoism and stimultates,aspirations. Every tendency has its origin in the mind. It augments passions? gives strength to hope and awakens the sense of duality. It increases ignorance and plunges the senses in the ocean of senseobjects. It creates distinctions and differences. It separates? divides and limits. It is a strong wall or an iron barrier that stands between the individual soul and the Absolute. It is this mind that has brought Brahman to the condition of the individual soul. It is the storehouse of error? cravings? doubt? delusion and ignorance. It is an everrevolving wheel that generates thoughts. It is a miraculous thoughtproducing machine. It creates at one moment. It destroys at the next moment.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, this verse is all about the vibe, the total field and its modifications. It's dropping major knowledge from the Sankhya school, listing 24 principles. The five great elements—earth, water, fire, air, and ether—are, like, totally everywhere, in everything. We're talking subtle elements, not the, like, *gross* ones. Ego is the main cause of the elements, it's all about that self-importance. Intellect is the cause of ego, it's all about making decisions. The intellect comes from the Unmanifested, which is, like, the ultimate source energy. It's all connected, you know? Then there are the ten senses: five for knowing stuff (eyes, ears, etc.) and five for doing stuff (hands, feet, etc.). And the mind? That's the eleventh sense, the one that's always thinking and doubting. Finally, there are the five objects of the senses: sound, touch, sight, taste, and smell. At the end of the universe, everything—the elements, ego, intellect, senses, and mind—gets absorbed back into the Unmanifested. The mind is, like, *the* problem. It's Maya, it's ignorance, it's the root of all our problems. It fuels desires, creates fear, builds unrealistic expectations. It makes ego stronger, and it keeps us stuck in this cycle of wanting more. It creates all the drama, the differences, the separation. It's the wall between us and the Absolute. It's the source of all our messed-up thoughts and feelings. It's a total mind-f***."

All these are mental states and treated as properties of the body by the Sankhya school of thought. According to the NyayaYaiseshika schools? these are the inherent alities of the Self. The modifications have a beginning and an end. Only that which is unchanging can be the witness of these modifications. The knower of the field is unchanging. He is the witness of the field and its modifications.Desire is a modification of the mind. It is an earnest longing for an object. It is a Vritti (thoughtwave) born of Rajas which urges a man who has once experienced a certain object of pleasure to get hold of it as conducive to his pleasure when he beholds the same object again. This is the property of the inner sense. It is the field because it is knowable.You enjoy a certain sensual object. The impression of this is produced in the subconscious mind. This impression is vivified or revived through memory or remembrance of the sensual pleasure. Then desire arises to enjoy the object again. Repetition of the sensual enjoyment intensifies the memory and desire. Renunciation of the objects and meditation thin out the impressions and the desires.If anyone gives a description of the beautiful scenery of Badri Narayana or Mount Kailasa at once a desire arises in our minds to vist those places. If a man says that very good sweetmeats and mangoes are available in Bangalore? a desire to get these objects crops up in your mind. Therefore memory of sensual enjoyments and the hearing of the alities of the sensual objects are the root causes of desires. Hope fattens the desires. Hope gives a new lease of life to desires. Desire excites the mind and the senses. Desire makes the mind restless. Desire makes the mind wander in the sensual grooves.An object which is sweet and pleasant to you at one moment produces the very reverse of that sensation at another moment. Everyone of you might have had this experience. Objects are pleasant only when there is a longing for them. But they are unpleasant when there is no longing for them. Therefore desires are the cause of pleasure. If satisfaction arises through enjoyment of the objects? pleasure will cease. If your mind is destitute of desires then you will always enjoy serenity? eanimity? balance or poise in spite of many obstalces or adversities. The foundation of desire is the love of sensual pleasures. Desires run along the path of your inclination? proclivity or tendency or taste. Desire is the fuel. Thought is the fire. If you withdraw the fuel of desire? the fire of thought will be extinguished like an oilless lamp. The intellect becomes impure by association with desires.Hatred is a modification of the mind. It is a negative one. It is a Vritti that impels a man who,experienced pain from a certain object to dislike it when he beholds the same object again. Hatred also is field because it is knowable. The modification that arises in the mind when your desire is not fulfilled is called hatred.Pleasure is agreeable? peaceful? made of Sattva. This is also the field because it is knowable.Pain is disagreeable or unpleasant. It is also the field because it is knowable.Sanghata Aggregate? the combination of the body and the senses or the bundle of the 35 components of the body.Chetana Intelligence is a mental state which manifests itself in the aggregate just as fire manifests itself in a ball of iron. This is also the field because it is knowable. Chetana means consciousness and also the activity of the vital airs.Dhriti Firmness? courage? fortitude. It is a Sattvic modification of the mind. The body? the senses and the mind are sustained by firmness when they are depressed and agitated. The five elements are antagonistic to each other. Water destroys earth. Fire dries up water. Water puts out fire. Wind puts out a lamp (fire). Ether absorbs the wind. The five elements fight amongst themselves and yet they (that have a natural dislike for one another) dwell together ite amicably in the same body. Each element beautifully cooperates with the others in carrying on the common functions of the body harmoniously. Each element nourishes the other elements also with its own alities. Dhriti is firmness or the power by which these fighting elements are held in union and harmony and kept in a state of steadiness and balance. This is also the field because it is knowable.Desire and the other alities that are spoken of in this verse stand for all the alities of the mind. The field that is mentioned in the first verse has been dealth with in all its different forms in the fifth and the sixth verses.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, this whole 'field' thing? It's built on vibes, right? Desire, hate, pleasure, pain – all that mental stuff. Sankhya peeps see it as body stuff, but Nyaya-Vaisheshika are all, 'Nah, it's inherent to the self.' It's all temporary, tho. Only the unchanging witness – the real you – sees all this drama unfold. Desire? That's a total brainwave, a craving for something you've already experienced. It's like, you see that bomb-ass mango, remember how good it was, and BOOM, you *need* it. Meditation and chill vibes help you ditch that craving. Hate's the opposite – that 'I'm salty' feeling when you don't get what you want. Pleasure's chill, pain's not. The 'aggregate' is your whole body and senses, a total package. Intelligence is your brainpower, and fortitude is your mental strength, keeping all the elements of your body in check. It's like, fire, water, earth, air, and ether are all fighting, but your fortitude keeps them all in balance. This verse is all about the mind's many moods, man."

These are the attributes of the man whose mind is turned towards the inner wisdom. If these characteristics are seen in a man in their entirety? you can infer that the knowledge of the Self has dawned in him.Humility It is the negation of vanity. It is absence of selfesteem or selfpraise. The basis of pride is the consciousness of possessing something (wealth? knowledge? strength? beauty and virtuous alities) in a larger measure than others. A proud man possesses at least something but a man of vanity possesses nothing and yet he thinks he is superior to others. Vanity is exaggerated pride. A humble man dislikes respect? honour and praise. He shuns fame and distinction. He never shows his knowledge? ability? prowess? etc. He never praises himself.Absence of hypocrisy Hypocrisy is the desire to appear what one is not. A Sannyasi has some virtues and a little theoretical knowledge derived from books. He pretends to be a liberated sage. This is religious hypocrisy. A man in whom this is absent is simple and modest. He never advertises his own virtuous alities in order to get respect? name and worship from others. He will never disclose any meritorious or charitable act done by him. He is free from pedantry. He will never sell his knowledge in order to achieve fame.Ahimsa Noninjuring of any living being in thought? word and deed. He who practises Ahimsa places his feet very carefully on the ground and avoids stepping on any living creature. If he perceives any living creature in front of him he stops and turns to the other side. His heart is full of compassion.Kshanti Forbearance? patience? forgiveness. This is a true symptom of knowledge. The man of wisdom puts up with everything. He is not affected a bit when others injure him. He never retaliates. He bears insult and injury calmly.Arjavam Straightforwardness. The man of wisdom is upright or straightforward. He is free from cunningness or diplomacy? doubledealing or crookedness. He is ite frank? candid or openhearted. He does not hide anything. His thoughts and words agree. He speaks his mind openly to the people. He is as simple as a child in his speech. He has a heart as pure as a crystal. He never cheats others.Service of the teacher Devotion to the preceptor? worship of the Guru doing acts of service to him who teaches BrahmaVidya or the means of attaining liberation. Acharya is the Master in whom the divine wisdom is embodied. Service of the Guru enables the aspirant to attain Selfrealisation. The aspirant adores his Guru as Brahman? God Himself. He worships him as Lord Vishnu. He superimposes on him all the attributes of Brahman or Lord Vishnu. He realises Brahman in and through his Guru. This is the fruit of devotion to the Guru. For a student of Vedanta devotion to the Guru is absolutely necessary. Even for a correct understanding of the scriptures the guidance of a Guru is necessary.Purity is of two kinds? external and internal purity. External purity is cleansing of the physical body with earth and water. Internal purity is cleansing of the mind of the dirt of attachment? hatred and other passions? by the method of Pratipaksha Bhavana? i.e.? by cultivating the opposite positive virtues? and by the recognition of the evil in all objects of the senses.Steadfastness The aspirant never leaves his efforts on the path of salvation even though he comes across many stumbling blocks on the path. This is steadfastness or firmness. No meditation on Brahman is possible with a fickle mind.Selfcontrol is control of the aggregate of the body and the senses. The senses and the body which naturally run externally towards the sensual objects are checked and directed on to the path of salvation. No meditation is possible in a body wherein the senses are out of control and distract attention.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "These traits are like, totally the key to unlocking inner wisdom, you know? If someone's got all this going on – humility, no cap, chill vibes, forgiveness, being real, respecting their teachers, staying clean (inside and out), being consistent, and self-control – then they've def got that self-knowledge thing down. Humility? It's the opposite of being a total narcissist. It's not about self-esteem, it's about not being a show-off. Pride is all about thinking you're better than others because you've got more stuff (money, knowledge, whatever). But a humble person doesn't need to flex. No hypocrisy, either. That's all about pretending to be someone you're not. Like, a fake guru or something. Real people are chill and modest. They don't brag about their good deeds. Ahimsa? That's about not hurting anyone, ever. Like, seriously, watch where you step! Kshanti? That's patience and forgiveness. Wise people don't sweat the small stuff. They don't get petty. Arjavam? That's about being real and honest. No games, no BS. They're transparent AF. Respecting your teacher? That's about showing mad love to your guru, the one who's dropping wisdom bombs. Purity? It's about being clean, inside and out. Steadfastness? That's about sticking to your goals, even when things get hard. Self-control? That's about keeping your senses in check and focusing on your goals. No distractions."

His senses do not run towards them.Vairagyam Indifference to the senseobjects such as sound? touch? etc.? for pleasure seen or unseen? heard or unheard (for pleasure in heaven? too).Anahankara The idea that arises in the mind I am superior to all? is egoism. Absence of this idea is Anahankara or absence of egoism.Reflection on the evils and miseries of birth? death? old age and sickness One has to dwell in the womb for nine months and to undergo the pangs of birth. These are the evils of birth. The man of wisdom never forgets the troubles of birth? death? old age? etc. He wants to avoid being born. In old age the intellect becomes dull and the memory is lost and the senses become cold and weak. There is decay of power and strength. The old man is treated with contempt by his relatives. These are the evils of old age. A sick man who suffers from piles? suffers from weakness and anaemia through loss of blood. A man suffering from malaria gets an enlarged spleen. These are the evils caused by sickness.Pain The three types of pain or afflictions are referred to in the Introduction.Pain itself is evil. Birth is painful. Birth is misery. Death is misery. Old age is misery. Sickness is misery. Birth? death? etc.? are all miseries? because they produce misery or pain.By such reflection and perception of the evil in these arises indifference to the pleasures of the body and the sensual pleasures. Then the mind turns within towards the innermost Self to attain knowledge of the Self. As the perception of the evil of pain in birth helps to obtain knowledge of the Self? it is spoken of as knowledge.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, a wise person is totally unbothered by, like, sensory stuff. They're not even tryna talk about it. Their senses aren't, like, craving anything.

Think about the total suck of being born, dying, getting old, and being sick. Nine months in the womb, the pain of birth – total bummer. Old age is, like, your brain turning to mush, your senses going kaput, and everyone low-key disrespecting you. Sickness is, like, piles, anemia, malaria – major yuck. Pain is, like, the worst. Birth, death, old age, sickness – all major L's. Thinking about all this makes you, like, not care about physical pleasures. Your mind turns inward, you know? It's all about self-knowledge."

What's the opposite of knowledge? Lust, anger, greed, ego, fake-ness, attachment, being sneaky, playing politics, hurting others? That's ignorance, and it keeps you stuck in the cycle. To get that Self-knowledge, you gotta ditch that toxic baggage. It's like, those bad vibes are roadblocks to salvation. Cultivate the opposite vibes, and the bad stuff will just, like, *die*. It's way easier than fighting it head-on."

It has no ality like whiteness? blackness? etc. It has no relation or connection with anything else? because It is one without a second. It is no object of any sense. It is beyond the reach of the mind and the senses. It is actionless. It is the great transcendental and unmanifested Absolute. It is always the witnessing subject in all objects.The Vedas emphatically declare that Brahman is without attributes? activity? attachment or parts.In chapter IX. 19 it was stated that He is the being and also the nonbeing. It is now stated that He is neither being nor nonbeing. This would seem to the readers to be a contradiction in terms but it is not so. Though the manifest (perishable) and the unmanifest (imperishable) universe are both forms of Brahman? He is beyond both these. (Cf.VII.2XV.16?17and18)",

It's not in any category, no box to put it in. It's not white, black, or any color. It's not connected to anything else; it's the one and only. You can't sense it, think about it, or even put it in your mind. It's chillin', doing nothing, but it's the ultimate reality, the unseen boss of everything. The Vedas are all, 'Brahman's got no qualities, no action, no attachments, no parts.' Wait, what? In chapter 9, Krishna said Brahman is being *and* non-being. Now he's saying it's neither? No cap, it's not a contradiction. Brahman is beyond the whole universe, the seen and unseen stuff. It's way bigger than all that."

He fills and surrounds this world with Himself. He abides in the universe enveloping everything.In the previous verse it is said that the Brahman Which is to be known is neither being nor nonbeing. One may think that It is nonentity or void or nothing. In order to remove this misapprehension? the Lord says in this verse that the knowable has hands and feet everywhere? etc. It directs the mind and the senses to do their proper functions. This is only the manifest aspect of Saguna Brahman (Brahman with attributes).Just as the enginedriver drives the engine? so also the knowable or the knower of the field drieves the bodyengine. It is the Inner Ruler. It is the innermost Self. It is the support? substratum or basis for this world? body? mind? lifeforce and the senses. The existence of Brahman is determined or ascertained or indicated by the existence of the limiting adjuncts? viz.? body? mind and senses? because there must be selfconsciousness behind their activities. How can you call It nonexistence thenJust as the rope is not affected by the alities or the defects of the illusory superimposed snake? so also Para Brahman (the knower of the field) is not affected by the superimposed world? body? senses? mind and the lifeforce. There is only one common consciousness is eternal? selfluminous and allpervading. That common consciousness is Para Brahman.The body? mind? senses and the lifeforce are by nature insentient. But they are moved by Brahman to action. They act on account of the mere presence of Brahman or the knower of the field. (The limiting adjuncts are illusory.) Hence they put on the semblance of consciousness? just as the iron piece puts on the semblance of a magnet when it is in the presence of a magnet.The whole world is superimposed on Brahman like the snake on the rope. This is called Adhyaropa. It is sublated by the method (Yukti) of Apavada (negation or denial).This verse is taken from the Svetasvataropanishad 3.16.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, the Brahman, the ultimate reality, is *everywhere*. It's not some void or nothing; it's totally vibing in the universe.

It's the real deal, the OG consciousness. Even though our bodies and minds aren't conscious on their own, the Brahman makes things happen. It's like, the Brahman is the magnet, and our stuff is the iron filings – we only seem conscious because of the Brahman's presence. The whole world is just a projection onto the Brahman, like a glitch in the matrix. It's all connected, fam."

Even so? steps are necessary to reach the summit of the knowledge of the Self. That is the reason why Lord Krishna took Arjuna to the summit of knowledge step by step. He first taught Arjuna the nature of the field? then knowledge? ignorance or nonwisdom? and ultimately the knowable. When a child is to be fed,the intelligent mother divides the food into small portions and feeds the child little by little. Even so Lord Krishna fed His spiritual child Arjuna with the spiritual food little by little.Lord Krishna says O Arjuna I will give you the same teaching in another form by the description of the Spirit and Nature.Till now the Lord expounded the knowledge of the field and the Self in accordance with the philosophy of the Upanishads. Now He explains the same knowledge in accordance with the Sankhya philosophy? but without accepting its dual nature in the form of discrimination between the Spirit and Nature.Vikaras Modifications from the MahatTattva or intellect down to the physical body the twentyfour principles of the Sankhyas. The Self within is changeless. All changes take place in Nature. Mulaprakriti (the Primordial Nature? the Unmanifested) becomes modified into Mahat? egoism? mind? the great elements and other minor modifications.Just as coolness and ice? the day and the night? are inseparable? so also matter and Spirit are inseparable. The three alities Sattva? Rajas and Tamas are born of Nature (matter). All actions proceed from the mind? the lifeforce? the senses and the physical body.According to the Sankhya philosophy? Prakriti and Purusha are not only eternal and beginningless but also independent of each other and selfcreated. According to Vedanta philosophy? Prakriti or Maya originates from Brahman and is? therefore? neither selfcreated nor independent. Isvara has Maya under His perfect control. Maya is His causal body. Maya is His illusory power.Matter and Spirit are the Natures of Isvara. Know that these two are beginningless. That which has no beginning is Anadi. As Isvara is eternal? His two Natures also should be eternal. (This is according to the Sankhyas.)Isvara possesses these two Natures (superior and inferior) by which He causes the creation? preservation and destruction of the universe. Therefore He has the Lordship and rules over the universe. The two Natures have no beginning. Therefore they are the cause of Samsara.The inferior Nature (Apara Prakriti) which consists of the eightfold division of Nature referred to in chapter VII? verse 4? is the Prakriti of chapter XIII? verse 19. The superior Nature (Para Prakriti) referred to in chapter VII? verse 5? is the Purusha of chapter XIII? verse 19. Purusha here means Jiva (the individual soul).Even a child smiles and experiences exhilaration? grief? fear? anger? pleasure and pain. Who taught it The impressions of the virtuous and vicious actions of this birth cannot be the cause of these. The impressions of the previous birth alone are the cause of all these. They (the impressions) must have a support. From this we can clearly infer the existence of the individual soul in the previous birth and that the individual soul is beginningless. If you do not accept that the individual soul is beginningless? the two defects of Kritanasa (nonfruition of actions performed) and Akritabhyagama (causeless effect) will creep in. Pleasure and pain which are the fruits of virtuous and vicious actions done previously will pass away without being experienced. This is the defect of Kritanasa. So also? one will have to enjoy pleasure and pain? the fruits of good and bad actions which were not done by him previously. This is the defect of Akritabhyagama. In order to get rid of these two defects we will have to accept that the individual soul is beginningless. The scriptures,also emphatically declare that the soul is beginningless.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Yo, so like, the Gita's sayin' that matter and the spirit are both, like, *ancient*. No start date, fam. And all the changes and vibes? They're totally born from matter. It's like, building a skyscraper, you gotta take it step by step, right? Krishna's teaching Arjuna the same way, starting with the basics and building up to the ultimate truth. It's like feeding a baby, you gotta give 'em small bites, not a whole plate of food at once. Krishna's dropping knowledge on Arjuna bit by bit. He's explaining the same stuff in different ways, using the Sankhya philosophy, but without getting too hung up on the whole matter vs. spirit debate. Changes? That's all matter, fam. The self within? That's unchanging. Think of it like ice and coolness, or day and night—they're inseparable, just like matter and spirit. The three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas)? Totally born from matter. All actions come from the mind, life force, senses, and body. Sankhya says matter and spirit are eternal and independent, but Vedanta says matter comes from Brahman, so it's not independent. Isvara's got total control over matter. Matter and spirit are Isvara's nature, and they're both timeless. Isvara uses these two to create, preserve, and destroy the universe. They're the cause of samsara (the cycle of birth and death). The 'inferior' nature is the Prakriti from chapter 13, verse 19, and the 'superior' nature is the Purusha from the same verse. Purusha here means the individual soul. Even babies feel joy, sadness, fear, anger, etc. Where do those feelings come from? Not just this life, but past lives too. That means the soul has to be timeless. If you don't believe in a timeless soul, you get into all sorts of logical problems. The scriptures say the soul is timeless, so there you go."

The force of desire acts on the mind and the mind impels the senses to act to get the objects of desire. Good and evil actions proceed from Nature and lead to happiness or misery. Evil actions produce misery and sorrow. Virtuous actions cause happiness and joy. The soul is the enjoyer. The wife works and prepares nice? palatable dishes the huand silently enjoys the fruits of her labour. He sits ietly and eats them to his hearts content. Even so Nature works and the soul experiences the fruits of Her labour? viz.? pleasure and pain.When harmony predominates? virtuous actions are performed. When there is a preponderance of Rajas? both virtuous and vicious actions are performed. When Tamas predominates? sinful? unlawful and unrighteous actions are done.In the place of Kaarana (कारण) which means cause? some read Karana (करण) which means instrument such as the five organs of knowledge? five organs of action? mind? intellect and egoism (thirteen principles located in the body).Karya The effect? viz.? the physical body. The five elements which form the body and the five senses? and which form the senseobjects which are born of Nature come under the term effect. All alities? such as pleasure and pain and delusion which are born of Nature? come under the term instruments because these alities reside in the instruments? the senses.In the production of the body? the senses and their sensations Nature is said to be the cause. Thus Nature is the cause of Samsara.Sugarcane is the cause. Sugarcane juice? sugar and sugarcandy are the effects or modifications of sugarcane. Milk is the cause. Curd? butter and ghee (meleted butter) are the modifications of milk. Whatever is a modification of something is its effect? and that from which the modifications come is their cause. Nature is the source or cause of all modifications. She generates everything. The ten organs? mind and the five objects of the senses are the sixteen modifications or effects.Mahat (intellect) is born of Mulaprakriti. From Mahat Ahamkara (egoism) is born. Mahat is the effect of Mulaprakriti and the cause of Ahamkara. Therefore Mahat is called PrakritiVikriti. Mahat? Ahamkara and the five Tanmatras (rootelements of matter) are the seven PrakritiVikriti. Each of these is a modification of its predecessor and is in turn the cause of its successor. The five rootelements generate the five gross elements. They are the subtle elements. These seven are both Nature and modification (Prakriti and Vikriti)? cause and effect? and are included under the term cause.The functions of the body? senses? lifeforce? mind and intellect are superimposed on the pure Self. So the ignorant man says I am black I am fat I am hungry I am angry I am deaf I am blind I am the son of so and so? I know? I am the doer? I am the enjoyer? etc.The intellect is very subtle. It is in close contact with the most subtle Self. The Consciousness of the Self is reflected in the intellect (Chidabhasa) and so the intellect which has the semblance of,the Consciousness feels I am pure consciousness or Chaitanya. I experience pleasure and pain. The attributes of the pure Self are superimposed on the intellect. There is mutual superimposition between the intellect and the Self? Nature and Spirit. This is the cause of Samsara.Purusha? Jiva? Kshetrajna and Bhokta are all synonymous terms. Purusha here referred to is not the Supreme Self. He is the conditioned soul? the soul subject to transmigration who experiences pleasure and pain. The Self or the Absolute is ever free from Samsara and is unchanging.Prakriti and Purusha are the cause of Samsara. Nature generates the body? lifeforce? mind? intellect and the senses. The soul experiences pleasure and pain. Samsara is the experience of pleasure and pain. The soul is the Samsarin. He is the experiencer of pleasure and pain. (Cf.XV.9)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, nature's totally the OG cause of everything, right? It's all about cause and effect. But when it comes to feeling good or bad, that's all on the soul. It's all vibes, you know? Good or bad actions are all nature's doing, leading to happiness or misery. It's like, your actions are the recipe, and nature's the chef. The soul is just the one vibing with the results. It's like, your girl slaving away in the kitchen, and you're just chilling, eating the bomb food she made. That's the soul and nature. When things are chill, you do good stuff. When things are chaotic, you do both good and bad. When things are straight-up sus, you do bad stuff. The body, senses, and all that are effects, nature's creations. It's like, sugarcane makes juice, sugar, candy—all modifications. Nature is the ultimate source, creating everything. The mind, body, and senses are all nature's creations. It's all interconnected. The intellect is super subtle, connected to the self. The self's consciousness reflects in the intellect, so the intellect thinks it's experiencing everything. It's like a projection. It's all a big mix-up between the intellect and the self, nature and spirit. That's the cycle of life, the whole samsara thing. The soul, the jiva, the experiencer—they're all the same. It's not the supreme self, but the soul experiencing the ups and downs. Nature creates the body and mind, and the soul feels it all. Samsara is all about that experience."

But that attachment to the vibes is what makes it think it's an individual, and *boom*, reincarnation. It's all about the soul's attachment to pleasure, pain, and delusion. That's the main reason for the whole reincarnation cycle. 'Good wombs'? Think gods and stuff. 'Evil wombs'? Think lower animals. Humans? It's a mix, depending on their karma. The soul being in Nature is ignorance. Attachment to Nature's vibes is desire. Ignorance and desire? That's the whole reincarnation thing. Wisdom and chill vibes? Those kill ignorance and desire."

When the priests and the sacrificer perform the sacrificial rites? an expert who has good experience in sacrifical matters sits by their side. He does not take any part at all in the sacrifice. He sits as a silent witness. He guides them. He points out their defects and corrects them. Even so the Supreme Self does not act. It does not take any part in the activities of the body? the mind and the senses. It is entirely distinct from them. It is a silent witness of their activities. It sits near Nature and silently watches Her actions.It may be explained in another way. The body? the eyes? the mind? the intellect and the Self are the,seers. Of these the body is the most external seer the Self is the most internal and nearest seer. Beyond the Self there is no other internal seer.Anumanta Permitter. The Supreme Self gives consent. It expresses Its approval or satisfaction regarding the actions done by the senses? the mind and the intellect. The King consents and says Yes.

It is different from them? just as the father who supports the children is different from them.Bhokta Enjoyer the Self? of the nature of eternal intelligence. Just as heat is the inherent nature of fire? so also eternal intelligence is the inherent nature of the Self. All the states of the mind such as pleasure? pain and delusion are permeated and illumined by the intelligent Self. Just as Govindan who takes the food is different from the foo? so also the Self is different from the intellect? the mind and the senses.Mahesvarah The great Lord. As He is the soul or essence of everything and as He is independent of all? He is Mahesvara. The sky is very big. Mahesva is bigger than even the sky? and so He is called Mahesvara. Just as the king is different from his subjects? so also the Self is different from Nature and the effects or modifications of Nature.Paramatma The Supreme Self. It is supreme because It is superior to all those things? from the Unmanifested to the physical body? which are mistaken for the Self on account of ignorance. Just as an iron piece moves in the presence of a magnet so also the mind and the intellect which are insentient move and function in the presence of the Supreme Self. Just as the moon borrows its light from the sun? so also the mind and the intellect borrow their light from the Supreme Self. The Supreme Self is selfluminous. Mind and intellect have no selfluminosity. In the Vedas also He is called the Supreme Self.

Such is the advantage he gains from the discriminative knowledge of Spirit and Matter. He knows that he is eternal and changeless and that all changes are due to the modifications of Nature on account of its alities. The self through ignorance identifies itself with the body and suffers rirth.In whatsoever condition he may be? whether he is engaged in prescribed or forbidden acts (like Indra who killed the Purohita Visvarupa and many Sannyasins)? he is not born again? because the,actions (which are the seeds of rirth)? of one who knows the Spirit and Matter? who has gained the knowledge of the Self? are burnt by the fire of that knowledge. Just as the seeds that are fried in fire do not sprout again? so also the actions burnt in the fire of knowledge cannot produce new bodies or further births. In his case they are Karmabhasa (mere semblance of Karma). They are not effective causes and cannot produce further births. A burnt cloth cannot serve the purpose of the cloth.Those actions which are done with egoism and desire (expectation of fruits) will produce fruits or results. In the case of a wise man? the seeds of evil? viz.? ignorance? egoism? attachment? etc.? are burnt by the fire of knowledge. Therefore he cannot have rirths.The Karmas (Prarabdha) which have already started their operation by producing this present birth do not perish? notwithstanding the dawn of the knowledge of the Self. When an arrow is once sent out from a bow at a mark? it pierces the mark and continues to act till it falls to the ground when the full force with which it was dischared is exhausted. Even so the Prarabdha Karma which has given rise to the body continues to act till the inherent force is fully exhausted? although the sage has attained Selfrealisation through his body. But he is not in the least affected by this? because he has no identification with the body? and as he has identified himelf with Brahman or the Absolute. If a carbuncle or cancer arises in the body on account of Prarabdha Karma? he will not suffer a bit as he has risen above bodyconsciousness? and as he stands as a witness of his body. But a bystander or a spectator wrongly imagines that the liberated sage is also suffering like an ordinary worldly man. This is a serious and sad mistake. From the viewpoint of the liberated sage he has neither body nor Prarabdha Karma.An arrow that is placed ready on the bow but not discharged with force can be withdrawn. Similarly? the Karmas which have not begun to generate their fruits or effects can be neutralised or destroyed by the knowledge of the Self. Therefore it is proper to say that the liberated sage is not born again. He will not take another body when the body through which he attained knowledge perishes. As ignorance? the cause of this body? is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self? birth? the effect of ignorance? is also destroyed. As one takes birth through virtuous and vicious actions? a sage will not take birth as his virtuous and visiouc actions (the whole Sanchita or accumulated Karmas of his previous births) are destroyed by the knowledge of the Self. The Karmas done by him after he has attained Selfrealisation cannot touch him at all as he has neither egoism (agency) nor desires. (Cf.XIII.32)",

You're, like, *beyond* it. It's like, you're watching a movie of your life, not *living* it. People might think you're suffering, but, like, nah, you're good. You're not even in the movie anymore. It's only the actions that haven't started yet that can be, like, *undone* by knowledge. So, yeah, no more rebirths. It's like, game over for the cycle of birth and death. Ignorance is gone, so birth is gone. It's all about the knowledge, fam."

The first path is the Yoga of meditation taught by Maharshi Patanjali. The Raja Yogins behold the Supreme Self in the self (Buddhi) by the self (purified mind). Meditation is a continous and unbroken flow of thought of the Self like the flow of oil from one vessel to another. Through concentration hearing and the other senses are withdrawn into the mind. The senses are not allowed to run towards their respective sensual objects. They are kept under proper check and control through the process of abstraction. Then the mind itself is made to abide in the Self through constant meditation on the Self. The mind is refined or purified by meditation. The mind that is rendered pure will naturally move towards the Self. It is not attracted by nor is it attached to the sensual objects.Sankhya Yoga is Jnana Yoga. The aspirant does Vichara (analysis? reflection) and separates himself from the three alities of Nature? the three bodies and the five sheaths and identifies himself with the witness (Self). He thinks and feels? I am distinct from the three alities. I am the silent witness. I am unattached. I am nondoer. I am nonenjoyer. I am immortal? eternal? selfexistent? selfluminous? indivisible? unborn and unchanging.The Karma Yogi surrenders his actions and their fruits to the Lord. He has Isvarapana Buddhi (intelligence that offers everything to God). This produces purity of mind which gives rise to knowledge of the Self. Karma Yoga brings about concentration of the mind through the purification of the mind. It leads to Yoga through the purification of the mind and so it is spoken of as Yoga itself.Those who practise Sankhya Yoga are the highest class of spiritual aspirants. Those who practise the Yoga of meditation are aspirants of the middling class. Those who practise Karma Yoga are the lowest class of spiritual aspirants. The aspirants of the middling and lowest class soon become aspirants of the highest class through rigorous Sadhana or spiritual practices. (Cf.V.5VI.46)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, there are, like, a bunch of different ways to, like, totally reach self-knowledge, you know? It depends on your vibe and what you're about.

Then there's this other thing, Sankhya Yoga, which is all about knowledge. You, like, analyze everything, separate yourself from all the drama, and realize you're this, like, total witness, you know? And then there's Karma Yoga, where you just, like, do your thing and let go of the results. It's all about purifying your mind, which leads to self-knowledge. Like, the Sankhya Yoga peeps are, like, the OG spiritual masters, the meditation people are, like, mid-level, and the Karma Yoga people are, like, the newbies.

He destroys this body and takes another body and so on. But he who beholds the one Self in all beings does not destroy the Self by the self. Therefore he attains the Supreme Goal? i.e.? he attains release from the round of birth and death. Knowledge of the Self leads to liberation or salvation. Knowledge of the Absolute annihilates the ignorance in toto. If the ignorance is destroyed and false knowledge is also destroyed? all evils are simultaneously destroyed.Those who have realised that unity of the Self in all these diverse forms are never caught in the meshes of birth and death. They attain the state of Turiya (the fourth state beyond waking? dreaming and deep sleep) where form and sound do not exist.The self is everybodys friend and also his enemy as well.

Therefore It is without alities. It is Nirguna. The activity in Nature is really due to its own alities which inhere in it. The Supreme Self existed before the body came into being and will continue to be after its dissolution. It is eternally the same and imperishable.Avyaya That which is free from the changes of birth and death or appearance and destruction. That which has a beginning has birth. After the object is born it is subject to the changes of being (growth? decay? etc.). As the Self is birthless? It is free from the changes of state (existence? birth? growth? change? decay and death). As the Self is free from all sorts of functions? It is Avyaya. Even if the reflection of the sun in the water moves? the sun does not move a bit. Even so the Supreme Self is not touched by the fruits of action as It is not the doer? as It is without the alities of Nature? or limbs? indivisible? devoid of parts? without action? beginningless and unattached and causeless.This Supreme Self is free from the three kinds of differences? viz.? Sajatiyabheda? Vijatiyabheda and Svagatabheda. A mango tree is different from a fig tree. This is Sajatiyabheda. A mango tree is different from a stone. This is Vijatiyabheda. In the same mango tree there is difference between leaves? flowers and fruits. This is Svagatabheda. But the Supreme Self is one without a second. There is no other Brahman Which is eal to It. Therefore? there cannot be Sajatiyabheda in Brahman. This world is a mere appearance. It is a mere figment of our imagination. It is superimposed on the Absolute on account of ignorance. An imaginary object has no independent existence apart from its substratum? just as the snake in the rope has no independent existence apart from its substratum? the rope. Therefore? there cannot be Vijatiyabheda in Brahman. Brahman is indivisible? partless? without alities? without form and without any limbs. Therefore there cannot be Svagatabheda in Brahman.Brahman or the Supreme Self is beginningless. It is without a cause. It is selfexistent. It is without parts. It is without alities. Therefore Brahman is imperishable. As It is unattached? It is neither the doer nor the enjoyer. If Brahman also is the doer and enjoyer. It is no longer Brahman. It is in no way better than ourselves. This cannot be. Agency and enjoyment are attributed to the ego on account of ignorance. It is Nature that acts. (Cf.V.14XV.9)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so the Supreme Self is like, totally beyond nature, right? It's got no qualities, it's *nirguna*. All the action stuff in nature? That's because of nature's own vibes. The Supreme Self was *always* there, before the body even existed, and it'll still be there after we're all gone. It's like, eternally the same, unbreakable, *avyaya*. Think of it like this: a sun's reflection in water moves, but the sun itself doesn't budge. The Supreme Self is not affected by actions because it's not the one *doing* them. It's got no qualities, no parts, no action, no beginning, it's just... *there*. It's beyond all those differences – like, a mango tree is different from a fig tree (that's one type of difference), a mango tree is different from a rock (another type), and even on one mango tree, the leaves, flowers, and fruit are different (yet another type). But the Supreme Self? It's one of a kind, no duplicates. This world? It's all an illusion, a total mind-trip. It's like a fake snake on a rope – the snake isn't real, it's just a trick of the light. The Supreme Self is indivisible, no parts, no qualities, no form, no limbs. It's *always* been there, no cause, it just *is*. It's unattached, so it's not the one doing stuff or enjoying the results. If it *was* the doer and enjoyer, it wouldn't be the Supreme Self anymore. It's the ego that thinks it's in charge, because of ignorance. It's nature that's actually doing all the acting."

VII. 4 and 5)? the field and its knower. I unite these two (the Spirit and the matter). The individual soul comes under the influence of the limiting adjuncts? viz.? ignorance? desire and action. On account of ignorance (Avidya)? the individual soul forgets his original divine nature? gets himself entangled in the meshes of desire (Kama) and action (Karma)? and revolves in the wheel of birth and death. The individual soul turns towards ignorance without knowing his own true divine nature. The Jiva (individual soul) being overpowered by ignorance and the modifications? forgets its pristine purity and moves in various forms.The Primordial Nature or the Unmanifested is a dark matrix with infinite potentialities. It is not a substance. Sound and energy are in an undifferentiated state in It. The whole world gets involved into It during the cosmic dissolution. There is no relationship of substance or ality between It and the three Gunas. The alities are the Mulaprakriti and the latter is the former in a state of poise or eilibrium. This manifested world of the three alities is compared to a twisted rope of three colours? viz.? white? red and black. Each colour represents a Guna. Sattvic is white? Rajas is red and Tamas is black. The three are not in a state of eilibrium in the manifested world.Water and the seed coming in contact with the earth produce sprouts which grow into trees. In the womb of Nature? the seed develops into the eightfold elements -- earth? water? fire? air? ether? mind? intellect and egoism. The first fruit of the contact of Nature with the soul is the MahatTattva or intellect. From intellect mind is born from mind egoism from egoism? the five elements.There are four classes of beings? viz.? Jarayuja? Andaja? Svedaja and Udbhijja. The Jarayuja is born of the placenta (viviparous). Human beings? cows? elephants? horses? etc.? belong to this class. In this variety the five senses of knowledge exist. The Andaja is born of eggs (oviparous). In this variety the elements of wind and ether predominate. Lice come under the category of Svedaja they are born of sweat. In this variety fire and water predominate. Trees that are born of seeds are classified under the head Udbhijja in this variety earth and water predominate. (Cf.VII.6IX.17XV.7)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, my womb is, like, totally the ultimate source, the big Brahma. I'm dropping the germ, the seed, into it, and boom! That's where all beings come from, fam. It's like, the ultimate cosmic womb, the source of everything. It's called the great Brahma because it's where the five elements chill, and it's also the cosmic mind. It's the OG source, the Mulaprakriti, the primordial nature, the original principle. Vedantins call it Maya, the illusion, Sankhyas call it Prakriti. It's the biggest thing ever, greater than all its effects. It's the material cause of everything, the source and the energy that nourishes everything. I put the embryo of life in it, and then everything starts popping off. It's like the clay, but it doesn't create the forms itself. It gives birth to Brahma, who creates everything, like a potter with clay. I've got two Saktis, the superior and inferior natures, the field and the knower. I unite them, the spirit and the matter. The individual soul gets caught up in ignorance, desire, and action. Because of ignorance, they forget their divine nature, get tangled in desire and karma, and get stuck in the cycle of birth and death. The Jiva, the individual soul, gets overpowered by ignorance and forgets its purity. The unmanifested is a dark matrix with infinite potential, not a substance. Sound and energy are undifferentiated. The whole world gets absorbed into it during cosmic dissolution. The three Gunas aren't a substance, they're like a twisted rope of three colors: white (sattvic), red (Rajas), and black (Tamas). They aren't balanced in the manifested world. Water and seed on earth make sprouts that grow into trees. In the womb of nature, the seed develops into the eight elements: earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect, and ego. The first fruit of nature and soul contact is MahatTattva, or intellect. From intellect comes mind, from mind ego, from ego the five elements. There are four types of beings: Jarayuja (placenta), Andaja (eggs), Svedaja (sweat), and Udbhijja (seeds). Humans, cows, etc. are Jarayuja; birds are Andaja; lice are Svedaja; and plants are Udbhijja."

Rajas comes next. Tamas is the lowest and the worst. The three alities indicate the triple mentality. They produce attachment in the individual souls? delude them and bind them down? as it were? to Samsara. Just as the three conditions of childhood? youth and old age are found in the same body? so also the three alities inhere in the mind. The soul gets limited by identifying itself with body and the three alities. It is subject to birth and death and experiences happiness and misery? pleasure and pain? joy and sorrow till it realises its identity with the supreme Self.The word Guna is usually translated as ality. It does not signify property? attribute or ality? such as the blue colour of a cloth. Gunas are really the primary constitutents of Nature and are the basis of all substances. Therefore it is not proper to call them alities inhering in substances.If you want to attain freedom or perfection? if you wish to become immortal? you must rise above the modes of Nature. You must transcend the Gunas.If the water in the vessel is agitated? the reflected sun in the water also appears to be agitated through Pratibimba Adhyasa (superimposition of reflection on water). Even so the pure unchanging Self appears to be bound by the alities of Nature through superimposition. In reality the Self is ever free and untainted. It is beyond them.The Gunas which are only forms of ignorance are ever dependent on the knower of the field. They bind? fast? as it were? the knower of the field. They have him as the basis of their existence.A knowledge of the Gunas and their operation is very necessary. Only if you have this knowledge can you free yourself from their clutches.Mahabaho Mightyarmed with strong and sinewy arms reaching down to the kness. This is a very auspicious sign. Yogis and sages have such beautiful arms.These three Gunas are present in all human beings. No one is free from the operation of any one of the three alities of Nature. They are not constant. Sometimes Sattva predominates at other times Rajas or Tamas predominates.Sattva has the characteristic of effulgence. It is also harmony and goodness or purity. Rajas is passion or activity. Tamas is inertia or darkness.Analyse all phenomena in terms of these three. Know their characteristics. Stand as a witness of these alities. Do not identify yourself with them. Separate yourself from them. Become a Gunatita. You will attain Supreme Peace? immortality and eternal bliss. (Cf.XIII.22)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, sattva is, like, the GOAT. Rajas is kinda mid, and tamas is total trash. These three vibes, they're, like, totally messing with your head. They're making you cling to stuff, tricking you, and trapping you in this endless cycle of life and death. It's like, you know how you go through childhood, then adulthood, then old age? It's the same with these three vibes in your mind. You get so caught up in your body and these vibes that you're stuck in this loop of birth, death, happiness, sadness, etc., until you realize you're way more than just your body and these vibes. Guna is usually translated as 'quality,' but it's more like the building blocks of everything. It's not like the blue color of your shirt; it's way deeper. To level up and become immortal, you gotta rise above these vibes. Think of it like a reflection in water—if the water's all choppy, the reflection looks messed up, right? It's the same with your true self—it's pure, but these vibes make it seem bound. But really, your true self is always free. These vibes are just ignorance, and they depend on you. They're like, attached to you. Knowing how these vibes work is key to breaking free. Mahabaho? That's like, someone with super ripped arms, a total power move. Everyone has these three vibes; no one's immune. They're not constant, either. Sometimes one vibe is stronger than the others. Sattva is all glow-up and good vibes, rajas is all about the hustle, and tamas is, like, total darkness. Analyze everything through these three vibes, witness them, but don't let them define you. Become vibe-transcendent, and you'll achieve ultimate peace, immortality, and eternal bliss."

This is ignorance. An attribute of the object cannot belong to the subject. All the alities from desire to firmness (Cf.XIII.6) belong to the field. From ignorance? nondiscrimination is born and so the individual self is not able to discriminate between the permanent and the impermanent? the subject and the object.Knowledge is an attribute of the Antahkarana (inner instrument? viz.? mind? intellect? the unconscious and the ego) but not of the Self.

A Sattva person is always comparing themselves, flexing on others, and being all, 'I'm so smart, I'm so happy.' It's all ego, and that's what binds them. They think their happiness and knowledge are part of their true selves, but it's not. It's all surface level stuff. Rajas and Tamas are also total pitfalls, so watch out. This whole 'happiness' thing is an illusion, a total mind game. It's all ignorance. You can't just slap attributes of the world onto your true self. All that stuff – desires, firmness, the whole shebang – that's all just part of the material world, not your soul. Because of this ignorance, you can't tell the difference between what's real and what's not, what's permanent and what's not. Knowledge is part of your mind, not your soul.

The more he acires? the more passionate and greedy he becomes. Desires multiply. Nothing gives him satisfaction. If he is a millionaire? he tries to become a multimillionaire. It is like petrol poured into the fire? which inflames it further. A Rajasic man loses his understanding and power of discrimination. His understanding is clouded.

On account of perversion of intellect misery appears to him to be happiness pain appears to him to be pleasure sorrow appears to be joy. His goal is money and women.

He thinks What will happen to me after my possessions are gone and thus worries himself unnecessarily and engages himself in endless activities. He has no peace of mind.He thirsts for what has not been attained and is attached to what has already been obtained. He wishes and tries to protect his possessions. This is Sanga.

The Sadhana for increasing Sattva is given in the 17th and 18th chapters.Each ality acts in its own turn at different times. All the three alities cannot operate at one and the same time. When one ality asserts itself or prdominates by overpowering or suppressing the other two? it produces its own effect. Sattva produces knowledge and happiness Rajas action Tamas veiling of knowledge? inertia? error? indolence? sloth and sleep. When Sattva is in the ascendant in a man? he is endowed with discrimination. Sublime thoughts roll in his mind. He has pure understanding. His mind turns away from sensual pleasures and moves inward towards the Self.What is the characteristic mark by which you can know that a particular ality is predominant or is in the ascendant The answer is given in the following three verses.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Yo, Arjuna, it's like this: Sattva's the vibe that's totally on top when Rajas and Tamas are low-key. Then Rajas is the dominant force, crushing Sattva and Tamas. And finally, Tamas takes over, dominating Sattva and Rajas. It's all about which one's winning at any given moment. Think of it like winter's chill after summer and fall are done, or sleep hitting hard when you're not dreaming or awake. Sattva's that good mood when Rajas and Tamas are chilling, making peeps feel all happy and stuff. Chapters 17 and 18 show you how to level up your Sattva game. Each of these energies has its own time to shine; they can't all be at their peak at once. When one's dominating, it's game on for its effects. Sattva's all about knowledge and happiness, Rajas is about the action, and Tamas is about being clueless, lazy, and stuck in a rut. When Sattva's your main energy, you're all about making smart choices, your mind's clear, and you're not into all that materialistic stuff. You're focused on your inner self. The next few verses will tell you how to spot which energy is running the show."

Just as jasmine scatters its fragrance far and wide? so also knowledge disseminates itself in all directions. Convert Tamas into Rajas and Rajas into Sattva. Now stand firm in Sattva. You will get increase of light? purity? peace and harmony. Sattva will lead you upwards. You will have an upward pull towards the Supreme Light. Sattvic diet? Japa? meditation? study of holy scriptures? living in seclusion? company of holy men? singing His Names and glories? and regulation of breath (Pranayama) will increase Sattva.Introspect. Look within. Watch the Gunas carefully. Be vigilant. Stand as a doorkeeper. Allow only Sattvic thoughts to pass through the door of the mental factory. Check Rajas. Curb Tamas. When Sattva predominates there is unruffled peace of mind? inner harmony? perfect serenity and tranillity. There is clarity or clear vision also. The understanding is not clouded. There is penetrative insight. The door or threshold of intuition is wide open. The senses will not run towards external objects.The senses are the avenues of senseknowledge. They are the gateways of perception for the Self. When light shines in all the gates of the body? such as the eyes? the ears? etc. (in other words when there is the manifestation of the BuddhiVritti of the Antahkarana)? then knowledge arises. You can understand by the mark of knowledge that Sattva is predominant. You can also know that Sattva is increasing by the mark of happiness. Just as the aspirant knows that Sattva is predominant in him by the marks of knowledge and happiness? so also he knows by the mark of knowledge that Rajas and Tamas are gradually decreasing.The ears shun whatever is improper to be heard. The eyes abandon what they should not look at. The tongue avoids to speak anything that is not right to speak of. The mind is not attracted by the sensual objects. Purity thus increases gradually by Japa? meditation? and selfrestraint. If there is increase of Sattva or harmony? there is also increase of knowledge. Sattva is the only sure means for the attainment of the knowledge of the Self. It lays the foundation of knowledge.",

They're stuck in the lowest vibe, and it's a total downwards spiral. Like, Sattva peeps become heavenly bosses after they're done with this mortal coil. Rajasic peeps are reborn as humans, no biggie. But Tamasic peeps? They're goin' down, like, reborn as animals or, like, the lowest of the low humans—total basic humans who are basically just animals in human suits. It's all about how you're attached to this whole nature thing, ya know? It's the illusion, the ignorance. That's why you get reborn as something high or low. It's all about your vibes, your happiness, your misery, your delusion—it's all tied to these Gunas. The previous verses were all about the Gunas, their functions, how they trap you in this cycle of rebirth, and what happens when one Guna is dominant. But the Lord's about to drop some truth: liberation is knowing the one who's above all this Guna stuff."

Light is the effect of Sattva? activity of Rajas and delusion of Tamas. The liberated sage does not hate them when they are present. When Sattva shines he is not carried away by pride. He does not think? I am a vey learned man. When the impulse for action is awakened in the body or when there is a divine call for him to do work for the solidarity of the world (Lokasangraha) he does not hate any action and he does not regret it after the action is accomplished. He feels no remorse while performing actions. The work is like the play of a child. While inertia increases in him? he is not deluded by infatuation.Only an ignorant man thinks Tamas has entered into me. I am deluded. I am under the influence of heedlessness? torpor? sloth? laziness and indolence. Now I am under the influence of Rajas. I am forced to do activities. This is painful. I have fallen from my true nature. This gives me a lot of pain. Now Sattva predominates in me. I am attached to happiness and knowledge. I am proud of my learning and better status.The liberated sage who has transcended the Gunas does not thus hate them when they are present.A man of Sattva or Rajas or Tamas longs for light? action or inertia which first manifested themselves and disappeared. But a liberated sage or one who has gone beyond the three alities does not at all long for these states which have vanished. This mark or characteristic is an internal mental state. It cannot be perceived or detected by others. It can be felt by ones own self alone. If one is endowed with clairvoyant vision or the inner eye of intuition? he can directly behold the longins that arise in the mind of another man.In the following three verses the Lord gives His answer to Arjunas second estion What is the conduct of the sage who has crossed over the Gunas",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, this is the tea on Arjuna's first question. Sattva is, like, the good vibes, Rajas is all about the hustle, and Tamas is the total chill-out mode. A woke sage isn't gonna, like, hate on any of those vibes when they're happening. When Sattva's shining bright, they're not gonna be all, 'OMG, I'm so smart!' When the action's popping off, or they're on a mission to save the world, they're not gonna be tripping about it. No regrets, fam. It's all good. When the chill is real, they're not gonna be all, 'I'm so messed up, I'm totally clueless.' Only a total noob is gonna be like, 'Ugh, Tamas got me, I'm such a mess.' A real G doesn't sweat the Gunas. They don't crave that Sattva glow, that Rajas hustle, or that Tamas chill when it's gone. It's all internal, you know? Only they can feel it. If you've got, like, psychic powers, you might see it, but otherwise, it's all in their head.

He then goes beyond the three alities and becomes fit to become Brahman? for attaining liberation or release from birth and death.He attains to the knowledge of the Self through the grace and mercy of the Lord. To these everharmonious devotees worshipping Me in love? I give the Yoga of discrimination by which they come unto Me. Out of pure compassion for them? dwelling within their Self? I destroy the ignorancorn darkness by the shining lamp of wisdom. (Chapter X. 10 and 11)Avyabhicharini Bhakti The devotee constantly meditates on the Lord. He has exclusive devotion to the Lord alone. He has no other thought save that of his Lord. His mind is filled with the thoughts of the Lord. His thoughts flow towards the Lord like the continuous flow of oil from one vessel to another. There is Sajatiya Vritti Pravaha? i.e.? unbroken flow of the one thought of God. There is total abandonment of thoughts of sensual objects. Constant thinking of God is the sure means for crossing beyond the three alities of Nature.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, a Sannyasi, or even a Karma Yogi, who's, like, totally devoted to the Isvara—the Narayana who's chillin' in everyone's hearts—is low-key enlightened AF. They're, like, *beyond* the three gunas, and totally ready to become Brahman. It's, like, total liberation from the cycle of birth and death. They get this knowledge through the Lord's grace, which is, like, major. For those devotees who are all about that worship life, I give them the ultimate cheat code—the Yoga of discrimination—so they can, like, *totally* connect with me. Out of pure compassion, I'm, like, *in* their hearts, destroying their ignorance with the glow-up of wisdom. It's all about that glow-up. No cap."

This peepul is said to be eternal because it cannot be cut except by the axe of knowledge.All persons depend upon the Lord for the fruits of their actions? because He alone knows the right relation between the actions and their fruits. He alone is the dispenser of the fruits of actions of human beings. The wise persons also depend upon the Lord for the fruit of their knowledge. The Lord alone removes the veil of ignorance through His grace and mercy. The inclination for Advaita Vedantic Sadhana arises through the Lords grace. The desire for the realisation of the Oneness is produced in the minds of wise men by the grace of the Lord? which is the antidote to all fears. (Avadhuta Gita? I.1)Those who serve the Lord with unswerving or singleminded devotion go beyond the three alities of Nature through His grace. They attain knowledge of the Self through the grace of the Lord and get release from the round of birth and death. Those who have a right understanding of the real nature of Brahman or the Supreme Being also get emancipation easily.The Lord teaches Arjuna in this discourse about the real nature of Brahman or the Supreme Self and the path that leads the soul to union with Him. The Lord describes the nature of Samsara or worldly life as a peepul tree in order to create nonattachment or dispassion? because he who is endowed with true and lasting dispassion alone is fit for attaining the knowledge of the Self. Samsara is compared to a tree. because it can be cut off like a tree.All the other trees have their roots below? but this peculiar? strange and most wonderful tree of Samsara (Maya) has its root above? in Brahman. This peepul tree is different from all other trees. Brahman is the resting place or support of everything. It is eternal. It is great. It is the most high. It is the Supreme Being. It is supreme over all things. It is the source of everything. Therefore it is said that It is the One above. This One above is the root of this tree of Samsara. Brahan Who is superior to all is Urdhva. That which has Brahman as its cause is Urdhvamulam.In the Puranas it is said The tree of the Unmanifest has sprung from Brahman. Buddhi is its trunk? the senseopenings are its hollows? the great elements its boughs? the senseobjects its leaves and branches? Dharma and Adhrama (virtue and vice) its beautiful flowers? pleasure and pain its fruits. Having cut asunder this tree with the powerful sword of the knowledge of the Self? and then having attained to the eternal bliss of Brahman? no one comes back from there again.Brahman is the root of this tree. It is the upper part of this tree and so It is called Urdhva. In reality there are no distinctions such as upward? downward or middle in the One Which is the indivisible unity.The name Asvattha is usually derived from Asvattha which means not standing or enduring or remaining till tomorrow. A means not Sva means tomorrow Ttha means remaining. This is ite an appropriate word for this worldtree which is ever changing and passing away.In the Katha Upanishad also there is a mention about this Asvattha tree (II.6.1). The Gita is an essence of the Upanishads only.Samsara is generally understood by the common people as meaning remaining surrounded by ones wife and children and doing ones daily duties. This is a restricted or narrow meaning. Samsara means the whole worldprocess or the cosmic manifestation or the everchanging phenomenal world. Hiranyagarbha? the individual souls? the cosmic intelligence? egoism? the rootelements? etc.? represent the brancehs of this tree of Samsara. They extend downwards. They evolve into grosser and grosser states. Therefore it is said that the tree has its branches below. Egoism is the sprout which goes downwards in three directions? viz.? the three alities of Nature.Mind is the offshoot. Then come the five elements? viz.? earth? water? fire? air and ether? and the five organs of knowledge. Then comes sound which stimulates the ears to hear sweet music. Then comes touch which stimulates the skin to enjoy soft things. Then comes form which stimultaes the eye to behold beautiful objects. Then comes taste which stimulates the tongue to enjoy palatable things. Then comes smell which stimulates the nose to enjoy fragrant and scented objects.From the roots of actions with expectation of fruits a new branch of rirth comes up. The mineral kingdom? the vegetable kingdom? the animal kingdom and the human kingdom are all branches of this tree of Samsara. Man does good and evil actions with the help of the body and takes births to experience the fruits thereof. The human body is the water for this tree of Samsara.The body itself is the peepul tree. The root is the cerrospinal nervous system (brain). The various nerves are the branches that ramify downwards to the various organs distributed over the body.Avyaya Eternal? because this tree rests on an unbroken seires of births without beginning and end it is thus eternal. It can be cut down by the sword of knowledge of Brahman. Just as the leaves of a tree protect it? so also the Vedas protect this tree of Samsara? treating of virtue and vice? with their causes and fruits.He who knows this tree of Samsara and its roots as described above is a knower of the Vedas. He is a knower of the teachings of the Vedas. Not even an iota remains to be known beyond this tree of Samsara and its root. He who knows it is omniscient. The Lord has eulogised the knowledge of the tree of Samsara and its root in order to encourage aspirants to acire this knowledge.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, this whole universe thing? It's totally a metaphor, a low-key sick peepul tree. It's, like, indestructible, you can't even chop it down unless you're, like, *really* woke and have the knowledge axe. Everyone's vibing off the Lord for their karma, 'cause only He knows the tea on cause and effect. He's the ultimate karma dispenser. Even the wisest peeps need the Lord's help to get that knowledge glow-up. It's all about the Lord's grace, unlocking that Advaita Vedanta vibe. The desire for oneness? That's straight-up Lord-given, the ultimate fear-buster. If you're all in on the Lord, no cap, you're transcending the three gunas, getting that self-knowledge, and escaping the endless cycle of rebirth. If you're all about that Brahman life, you're good to go. The Lord's dropping truth bombs on Arjuna about Brahman and the path to union. He's using the peepul tree to, like, *totally* drop the need for attachment. Only those with zero attachment can get that self-knowledge. Samsara is a tree, and you gotta chop it down. All other trees have roots down low, but this one? Its roots are up high, in Brahman. Brahman is the ultimate chill spot, eternal, supreme, the source of everything. That's the 'above' root. The Puranas are all about this tree springing from Brahman. Buddhi is the trunk, senses are the hollows, elements are the branches, sense objects are the leaves, dharma and adharma are the flowers, pleasure and pain are the fruits. Chop it down with the knowledge sword, and you're chilling in eternal Brahman bliss, no return trip. Brahman is the root, the top, the whole shebang. There's no up, down, or middle in the One. Asvattha? Means 'not lasting,' totally fitting for this ever-changing world tree. The Katha Upanishad is all about this tree too. The Gita is, like, the ultimate Upanishad summary. Samsara is usually about family and daily life, but it's way bigger than that. It's the whole cosmic shebang, ever-changing. Hiranyagarbha, individual souls, cosmic intelligence, ego, elements...all branches extending downwards, getting grosser and grosser. Ego is the sprout, then mind, then elements, senses, and all that. Actions with expectations create new branches, leading to rebirth. Mineral, plant, animal, human kingdoms...all branches. The human body is the water for this tree. The body itself is the peepul tree, the spine is the root, nerves are the branches. Avyaya? Eternal, because it's an endless cycle of births. Chop it down with Brahman knowledge. The Vedas protect this tree, talking about virtue, vice, causes, and effects. Knowing this tree and its roots? That's knowing the Vedas, knowing everything. The Lord's dropping this knowledge to help you level up."

This tree of Samsara is nourished by the three alities of Nature. The senseobjects are its buds and the roots which grow downwards are the bonds of Karma for those who lead a life of passion and attachment in this world? who are under the sway of likes and dislikes. The sprouts of this marvellous tree are the charming objects of the senses with their characteristics of sound? touch? colour? taste and smell. The roots? the Karmic tendencies from the past lives? grow downwards to generate the bonds of Karma in the world of men. These roots strengthen the bondage by further actions.The primal root is ignorance from which arises the eightfold Nature -- the five elements? mind? intellect and egoism. From the stem of the tree spring four branches called Svedaja? Andaja?,Jarayuja and Udbhijja. Eightyfour lakhs (eight million and four hundred thousand) of species came into being.One branch shoots straight upwards. This is the branch of Dharma which yields the fruit of enjoyment in heaven. Another branch is the branch of dispassion which yields the fruit of Selfrealisation. The sun? the planets? the manes and the sages have also come out of this wonderful tree. Above them are the branches of the worlds of Indra and the gods. Still higher are those of the sages and the men of austerities and penance. Still higher is the Satyaloka where Hiranyagarbha dwells.From man down to the immovable objects below and from him up to the realm of the Creator above? whatever regions are attained in accordance with the nature of knowledge or action? they are the ramifying branches of the tree of Samsara. They are nurtured and fattened by the three Gunas which form their material base.The senseobjects such as sound? touch? colour? taste and smell represent the buds that sprout from the branches of the physical bodies which are the products of actions.The highest root of this wondeful tree is Brahman. The secondary roots are the latent impressions (Samskaras) of likes and dislikes? which spread in this world of men and impel them to perform virtuus and vicious actions and bind them fast to actions.Now listen to the way by which this tree can be cut off. Only he who thus cuts his bondage to this tree of Samsara can be happy even in this world. He has the highest wisdom because he stands as a spectator of this tree and knows it as it is? without being tied to it.",

O Arjuna Thou mayest perhaps consider that such a huge tree cannot be uprooted by any means whatever. It is not so.

Is it necessary to pull down castles in the air or to break the horns of a hare or to pluck a flower growing in the sky or to get butter from the milk of a tortoise or oil from stone Similarly? O Arjuna? there is no reality in this tree. Therefore why should you entertain any fear as to whether it may be uprooted or not Its form as such is not perceived by anybody here it is like a dream or a mirage or an imaginary city in the sky formed by the clouds or caused by a juggler. It appears and disappears. This tree has DrishtaNashtaSvarupa like the mirage. That object which is destroyed when one beholds it is DrishtaNashta. Nobody has perceived the end? the origin or the foundation of this illusory tree. No one can say that it has arisen from such and such a place or point.Samsara or the peepul tree is inveterately deeprooted. You will have to struggle hard to uproot it with its seed or the selfreproducing deep root.Asanga Dispassion? freedom from attachment to children? wealth and the world.Dridhena Strong. You will have to cut the tree with a strong axe which is sharpened again and again on the whetstone of the practice of discrimination. Further your mind should be turned towards the Supreme Being with the strong determination that you can attain eternal bliss only in Him and that He is the ony Reality.The desire for sensual pleasure is Sanga. Its opposite (dispassion) is Asanga. Renunciation of the three kinds of Eshanas (desires)? viz.? children? wealth and the world (PutraVittaLokeshana) is Asanga. Just as the axe cuts the tree? so also dispassion cuts this tree of Samsara. Hence dispassion is termed an axe. Cutting the tree of Samsara is annihilation of egoism? ignorance? latent tendencies? and renunciation of the fruits of all actions? through the practice of dispassion? control of the mind and the senses? etc. (Cf.VII.14)",

When It shines? everything shines after It? by Its light? all these shine (Chap.II?5.15). The same idea occurs in the Svetasvatara Upanishad (6.14) and the Mundaka Upanishad (II.2.10). The sun? the moon? etc.? derive their light from Para Brahman. Nothing else is needed for illuminating the Supreme Being because It is selfluminous.Dhama paramam Supreme abode or superexcellent seat or Para Brahman.Though the sun is endowed with the power of illumining all? it cannot illumine the Supreme Being.यत् धाम वैष्णवं पदं गत्वा प्राप्य न निवर्तन्ते यत् च सूर्यादिभिः न भासयते तत् धाम पदं परमं मम विष्णोः।That abode? to which having gone? none returns? and which the sun? moon? stars? lightning and fire do not illumine? is the highest abode of Vishnu.(Cf.VIII.21)",

The sun ain't shining there, neither is the moon or stars, or even lightning. It's only when *It* shines that everything else gets lit. Same vibe in the Svetasvatara and Mundaka Upanishads. The sun, moon, etc.? They get their shine from Para Brahman. The Supreme Being? It's already lit, no need for extra lighting. 'Dhama paramam'? That's the ultimate crib, the supreme seat, or Para Brahman itself. Even the sun can't outshine the Supreme Being. It's the place where no one ever leaves, and the sun, moon, stars, lightning, and fire can't even touch it. That's Vishnu's ultimate spot."

The individual soul is a ray of the Lord. A ray of the Supreme Being enters Nature? draws to itself the five senses and the mind and becomes an embodied soul (Jiva) by assuming a body. Here is a description of how the subtle body or LingaSariria enters the gross body.Although the sun is reflected in water? it is not in any way tainted. When a crystal comes in,contact with a red cloth or red flower? it seems to be red but it is really not so. Even so the Supreme Beings is not in any way tainted by the actions of the individual soul.Ignorance is the limiting adjunct of the individual soul. On account of the limitation caused by this ignorance the soul experiences that it is the doer and the enjoyer. In essence the individual soul is identical with the Supreme Being or Brahman. When ignorance? the limiting adjunct or principle? is destroyed? the individual soul (Jiva) realises it identity with the Supreme Being (Brahman).Just as the ether in the pot becomes one with the universal ether when the limiting adjunct? the pot? is broken? so also the individual soul becomes one with Brahman when the limiting adjunct? ignorance? is annihilated. Just as there is no return of the potether after it has become one with the universal ether when the pot is destroyed? so also there is no return of the individual soul after the limiting adjunct (the Antahkarana? i.e.? mind and the other inner instruments) is destroyed. It becomes one with Brahman.Pratibimba (reflection) is only a portion of the Bimba (object). The reflected sun is only a portion of the real sun (the rays of the sun). When the water is removed the reflected sun goes back to the original sun? as it were. It does not return to the water again. Even so? when ignorance or the mind is annihilated? the Jiva (individual soul) which is a reflection of Brahman in ignorance is absorbed in the Bimba Brahman. It does not return to this world of birth and death.The individual soul is only an imaginary or fictitious portion of Brahman. It is not a real portion. For the Supreme Being is indivisible. It has no parts. If It has parts? It would be liable to destruction when the parts are disjointed or removed.The senses abide in Nature? in their respective seats such as ear? skin? tongue? eye and nose. A Sannyasi living in the caves of the Himalayas dreams that he is a married man and moves about hither and thither to get a job for his livelihood. Even so? the individual soul forgets its real divine nature? mistakes the impure? perishable body for the pure? immortal Self and imagines that it is the real actor and enjoyer by identifying itself with the body. It says? I am the Karta. I am the Bhokta. I am a soul bound by Samsara. I am happy. I am miserable. It becomes finite.In essence the Jiva is identical with Brahman. The difference is on account of delusion or imagination or superimposition. The illusion of difference is due to the limiting adjunct or principle (the mind) even as the illusion that the ether in the pot is different from the universal ether is caused by the limiting adjunct? viz.? the pot. Jivabrahmabhedabhranti (the delusion of the distinctior between the individual soul and the Supreme Being) is removed when the limiting adjunct (mind) is annihilated. In deep sleep the mind rests in a subtle state along with all the Samskaras (impressions) and Vasanas (tendencies) in its cause (primordial ignorance). Again it comes back from this state of ignorance when you return to the waking state. If the cause (ignorance) is destroyed by the knowledge of the Self? its effect (mind) is also annihilated.Just as the tortoise stretches out its head and feet which were in a state of Laya (absorption) in its body? so also the individual soul strecthces out its mind and senses which were in a state of absorption in primordial ignorance in deep sleep? to enjoy the sensual objects in the waking state.A ray of the Supreme Being enters Nature? draws to itself the five senses and the mind In this verse the formation of the astral body (LingaSarira or Sukshmasarira) is described.The Sruti declaresस एष इह प्रविष्टः आनखाग्रेभ्यः तत् सृष्ट्वा तदेवानुप्राविशत्।।That Supreme Being Itself? having created this aggregate of the body from the head to the toe? entered this body in the form of the Jiva.According to Vedanta there are nineteen principles? viz.? the five organs of knowledge? the five organs of action? the five vital airs (Prana? Apana? Vyana? Samana and Udana)? the mind? intellect? Chitta (the subconscious or the unconscious mind)? and egoism. We will have to conclude that the words the five senses and the mind point to the collection of the remaining thirteen principles also.Amsa This does not mean here a particle or portion which has been cut out. It is like the Amsar of the ether in the pot the ether is not cut out but still remains the whole ether. (Cf.XIV.3)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so the Lord is explaining how we, like, *become* individual souls. It's all about this eternal part of the Lord, this total vibe, entering the world of life. It's like, it grabs the five senses, and the mind is the sixth sense, and it's all chillin' in nature. It's not like the sun reflecting in water, it's not tainted or anything. It's like, a crystal next to a red flower, it looks red, but it's not *actually* red. The Lord isn't affected by what we do. Ignorance is the thing that limits us, making us think we're the ones doing stuff and enjoying stuff. But really, we're one with the Lord. When we ditch the ignorance, we realize we're the same as the Lord. It's like, the ether in a pot is the same as all the ether when you smash the pot. Same with us and the Lord. Once the ignorance is gone, we're one with the Lord, no going back. We're like a reflection, a part of the Lord, but not really a *part*. The Lord is, like, indivisible. The senses are in nature, in their spots. It's like a monk in the Himalayas dreaming he's married and working a 9-to-5. We forget our true nature, thinking this body is the real deal, thinking *we're* the ones doing stuff and enjoying stuff. But really, we're one with the Lord. The difference is all in our heads, like thinking the ether in a pot is different from all the ether. When we let go of that, we're one with the Lord. In deep sleep, our minds are chillin', and when we wake up, it's back. If we get rid of the ignorance, the mind goes too. It's like a turtle putting its head and feet back in its shell, then stretching them out again. A part of the Lord enters nature, grabs the senses and the mind. It's all about the astral body forming. The scriptures say the Lord created the body and entered it. It's all about these nineteen principles, the senses, the mind, and all that. 'Amsa' doesn't mean a piece that's been cut off, it's like the ether in a pot, it's still all the ether."

Individual souls are just, like, temporary illusions, like how ether in a pot seems limited but is actually part of the whole universe.

One is the individual soul called the perishable? the second is the imperishable or the Maya Sakti of the Lord and the third is the Purushottama or the Supreme Being.The perishable comprises the whole world of changing forms. From Brahma down to the tiny blade of grass? all movable and immovable objects? all that can be thought of by the mind? all that is made up of the five elements? all that is changing? all that has names and forms? all that appears to the naked eye and what is described as the body and the modifications of the field? in the thirteenth chapter? are Kshara or the perishable. Kshara is the changing one. It is the everchanging form of matter which is inert or insentient. Akshara is the changeless.In Samsara there are two categories arranged in two separate groups of beings? called Purushas? as they are the limiting adjuncts of the Purusha. Maya Sakti? the illusory power of the Lord? is the seed from which the perishable being takes its birth. It is the seat of all the latent impressions of desires? actions? etc.? of various perishable creatures. Maya Sakti is the Akshara Purusha. The unmanifest condition is generally described as deep ignorance or sleep for there is neither consciousness nor unconsciousness. It is only a potential state. It is the condition in which all forms of life with its accompanying limitations lie latent? just as the tree lies latent in the seed of the fruit. In this state matter and energy are one. In this state sound? matter and energy exist in an undifferentiated state. In this state the Gunas exist in a state of eilibrium.The imperishable is known as the Kutastha? i.e.? that which remains immovable like a heap. That which is at the root (Kuta) of all these beings is the Kutastha. Or? Kuta also means illusion? and Kutastha means that which manifests itself in diverse forms of illusion. That which conceals the Truth and shows the false thing and deceives the worldyminded people is Maya or Kuta. That which is of the form of the AvaranaVikshepa Sakti (veiling and vacillating power) is Kutastha. As this Maya Sakti cannot be destroyed except by the knowledge of the Self? it is said to be endless. That is the reason why this is called Akshara. That seed of Samsara has no end. Therefore? it is said to be imperishable in the sense that it is not destroyed in the absence of knowledge of the Self. But the seed is scorched or destroyed in toto when one gets the knowledge of Brahman. The,illusion vanishes and everything is realised as the one Cosmic Consciousness. Only the illusory perception of matter is destroyed.Purushottama or the highest Purusha is distinct from these two -- the perishable and the imperishable. He is not affected by the evils of the two vehicles or limiting adjuncts of the perishable and the imperishable. He is eternal? pure? intelligent and free by nature.",

It's all made of the five elements, it's got names and forms, it's all the stuff you see with your eyes. It's the whole 'body and modifications of the field' thing from Chapter 13. It's Kshara, the ever-changing, inert matter. Akshara is the opposite—the unchanging. In Samsara, there are two groups of beings, the Purushas. Maya Sakti, the Lord's illusion power, is the seed of the perishable. It's where all the desires and actions are stored. It's the Akshara Purusha. The unmanifest state is like deep sleep—no consciousness, just potential. It's where everything is latent, like a tree in a seed. Matter and energy are one, all the Gunas are balanced. The imperishable is the Kutastha—the immovable, the root of everything. Kuta can also mean illusion, so Kutastha is the one that manifests in different illusions. It's the thing that hides the truth and shows the false, deceiving peeps. It's the AvaranaVikshepa Sakti (the veiling and vacillating power). This Maya Sakti can't be destroyed without Self-knowledge, so it's endless, imperishable. But when you get that Brahman knowledge, the illusion vanishes. Purushottama, the highest Purusha, is different from the other two. He's not affected by the bad stuff of the perishable and imperishable. He's eternal, pure, intelligent, and free."

Self? इति thus? उदाहृतः called? यः who? लोकत्रयम् the three worlds? आविश्य pervading? बिभर्ति sustains? अव्ययः the indestructible? ईश्वरः Lord.Commentary Purushottama is beyond the universe though He pervades the three worlds. Therefore He is called the Supreme Being by the Vedas and men of this world. He pervades the three worlds and upholds them yet? He is not tainted by the world. He is above the world or worldliness.Just as the waking state is different from the dram or the deep sleep states? just as the orb of the sun is different from his rays or the mirage they casue? so also is the highest Purusha different from the perishable and the imperishable Purushas.The highest Purusha is the haven of peace. In Him all take their refuge and eternal rest. He is incomparable for He is selfcontained there is nothing like Him. He can only be compared to Himself. The imperishable Being (Akshara Brahman) Who is beyond the world and the Avyaktam (the Unmanifested) are essentially the same as the Purushottama Who transcends both the Kshara and the Akshara.The Purushottama is ite distinct from the two -- Kshara and Akshara. He is the Supreme Being. The physical body? the astral body and the causal body are also termed the Self. But these are secondary selves. Paramatma or the Supreme Self is the primary Self. Purushottama or Paramatma is the supreme or the highest when compared with the other secondary selves created by ignorance. He is the innermost consciousness of all beings. He is the support of everything. He is the Niyanta? the Inner Ruler. He is independent. Therefore He is known as the Supreme Self in the Vedanta.Anyah Another? ite distinct from the two.Lokatrayam The three worlds Bhuh (the earth)? Bhuvah (the midregion) and Svah (heaven) are the three worlds.Purushottama is further described as follows He is the imperishable and omniscient Lord Narayana Who permeates the three worlds by His vital energy and sustains them by His mere existence in them.Avyaya Imperishable? that which is free from the modifications such as birth? death? etc. Just as the king who rules his subjects and controls them is distinct from them? so also the Supreme Being Who is the ruler of the perishable and the imperishable is distinct from them. (Cf.VIII.20)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so Purushottama is like, totally beyond the universe, even though he's, like, *everywhere* in the three worlds. That's why the Vedas and, like, everyone calls him the Supreme Being. He's vibing in all three worlds, holding everything together, but he's not, like, *in* the drama. He's above all that mess. It's like, your waking life is totally different from dreaming or being deep asleep, right? Or the sun is different from its rays, and those rays are different from a mirage. Purushottama is *way* different from those other Purushas, the ones that are, like, totally mortal or immortal. He's the chillest dude ever, the ultimate safe space. Everyone goes to him for, like, *forever* peace. He's one of a kind; there's no one else like him. He's only comparable to himself. The immortal Being (Akshara Brahman), the one beyond the world, and the Avyaktam (the Unmanifested) are all, like, the same as Purushottama, who's beyond both the Kshara and the Akshara. Purushottama is *so* different from those two – Kshara and Akshara. He's the Supreme Being. Your physical body, your astral body, and your causal body are all called the Self, but those are just, like, *secondary* selves. Paramatma, the Supreme Self, is the *real* Self. Purushottama or Paramatma is the ultimate, the highest, compared to those other selves created by ignorance. He's the inner consciousness of everything, the support of everything, the ultimate boss, the Inner Ruler. He's independent. That's why Vedanta calls him the Supreme Self. 'Anyah' means another, totally different from the other two. 'Lokatrayam' means the three worlds: Bhuh (Earth), Bhuvah (the mid-region), and Svah (heaven). Purushottama is also, like, the imperishable and all-knowing Lord Narayana, who's in all three worlds with his energy, keeping everything going just by existing. 'Avyaya' means imperishable, not affected by birth, death, etc. It's like, a king ruling his people – he's totally different from them, right? The Supreme Being is the ruler of everything, mortal and immortal, and he's totally different from them."

If this most profound teaching is rightly understood? known or realised? it makes a man wise and gives him illumination. After this there is nothing left for him to know or strive for. He has reached the goal of life or the aim of human existence. He has arrived at the end of his journey. His endeavour for Selfrealisation is over. He has attained perfection. He has complete knowledge of the Supreme Being. He gets Brahma Jnana. He moves in the consciousness of the Divine. He beholds the Self everywhere. He lives in Brahman. He regards all activities as His divine play.When one realises Brahman? he has discharged all the duties of life. He is liberated from the bonds of Karma. He becomes a Jivanmukta or illumined  sage who has transcended the bodyconsciousness? the three alities of Nature? the three states of consciousness (wakeful state? dream and deep sleep)? the pairs of opposites and the cycle of birth and death. He knows fully well that rirth has been destroyed? that what has to be done has been accomplished? that lifes highest goal has been reached and that he has nothing more to do or to learn. He has understood the profound mystery of life -- the riddle of this universe. He is a Sarvavit or allknower.The whole of the Gita is called science? yet the fifteenth discourse alone is here declared as the science for the sake of eulogising it. The fifteenth discourse contains the intessence of the Gita? the Upanishads and the Vedas. This is the butter churned from the milk of the Vedas. It has been said that? He who knows the peepul tree knows the Veda (XV.1). The Lord has also said? It is I Who am to be known by all the Vedas (XV.15). Only when a man knows this science as taught above does he become wise -- but not otherwise. Whatever duty a Brahmana of the highest birth has to do? all that has been doen when one attains the knowledge of the Self. All actions in their entirety culminate in knowledge (IV.33). This is the fulfilment of the birth? particularly of a Brahmana because the twicorn accomplishes all his duties only by attaining to this? but not otherwise? says Manu Smriti.As you have heard from Me this truth about the Supreme Being? you are a happy man and you have done all your duties you have attained Selfrealistion.By using the words Anagha and Bharata? Lord Krishna hints that even when an ordinary man who knows this fifteenth discourse can attain knowledge of the Self and become a Kritakritya? then what to say of Arjuna who was sinless and who was born in a noble family with divine attributes The Lord? by using the word Anagha? also indicates that the Guru who is a knower of Brahman should instruct the most profound secret (the science of the Self) only to alified persons who are free from impurities of the heart or tossing of the mind? who are calm and endowed with the four means of salvation. The man of impure mind will not be able to grasp the truth. The sinful man with his perverted intellect will distort the truth and thus pave the way for the destruction of himself and his followers.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the fifteenth discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Supreme Spirit.   ,,",

In this chapter, Krishna describes explicitly the two kinds of natures among human beings - divine and demoniac. Those who possess demonaic qualities associate themselves with the modes of passion and ignorance do not follow the regulations of the scriptures and embrace materialistic views. These people attain lower births and further material bondage. But people who possess divine qualities, follow the instructions of the scriptures, associate themselves with the mode of goodness and purify the mind through spiritual practices. This leads to the enhancement of divine qualities and they eventually attain spiritual realization.",

Asuras and Rakshasas? in the ninth discourse (verses 12 and 13). He now describes them in detail in this discourse. The distinction between the god or the godman and the Asuras is clearly drawn in the first? second? third and fourth verses. Daivi Prakriti or the nature of the gods leads to Moksha or release from the round of birth and death. The nature of the Asuras and Rakshasas leads to bondage. This is an obstacle to the attainment of knowledge of the Self. The divine nature must be accepted and cultivated the Asuric and Rakshasic nature should be abandoned. All these alities are found in human beings. There are Sattvic people who possess the divine attributes there are Asuras and Rakshasas among human beings also? who are endowed with demoniacal alities? who are filled with excessive Tamas. In an ordinary man there is a mixture of the three Gunas. Tamas and Rajas pull a man downwards Sattva lifts a man upwards. Tamas and Rajas lead to bondage Sattva helps to attain salvation. Discipline yourself and develop Sattva This is the foundation of Yoga. This is the first preparatory discipline. The first rung in the spiritual ladder is reached by developing Sattva. When the mind is Sattvic? thee is calmness in it. Divine light can descend only when the mind is serene and cheerful.The Sattvic man controls the senses? does selfless service? and practises Japa? Pranayama? concentration? meditation? selfanalysis and eniry of Who am I He is not attracted by sensual objects. He has a burning desire for attaining Moksha. He is humble? generous? merciful? forbearing? tolerant and pious. He destroys his little personality. The Rajasic man is proud? intolearnt? egoistic? selfsufficient? lustful? hottermpered? greedy and jealous. He works for his own glory and fame and selfaggrandisement. he develops his own little vain personality.There is intimate connection between the Gunas and Karmas. The nature of the Karmas depends upon the nature of the Gunas. A Sattvic man will do virtuous actions. A Rajasic and Tamasic man will perform evil actions. It is the Guna that goads a man to do actions. The Self or Brahman is actionless. It is the silent witness.The Lord sums up in the first three verses the alities of a godly man who is inclined to the path of liberation. He then enumerates the alities of the demoniacal man. The theme of this chapter is the tracing of the difference between the divine and the Asuric nature.Virtue and vice are relative terms. The virtue of one period will become the vice of the other. From the transcendental point of view? there is neither virtue nor vice.Why should there be evil How did evil arise -- these are all transcendental estions (Atiprasnas). You can get answers to these estions only when you attain Selfrealisation. People unnecessarily rack their brains to get an answer to these estions. It is a serious mistake.Daivi Sampat (divine wealth or the wealth of divine alities) helps the aspirant to attain knowledge of the Self. The Sattvic or divine attributes such as fearlessness? purity of heart? control of the senses? etc.? constitute Daivi Sampat. They enable the aspirant to attain the highest state of superconsciousness (Nirvikalpa Samadhi) wherein the seer and the seen are united in one? the meditator and the meditated become identical. Divine alities or attributes which go to augment the bliss of the Self? which help the aspirant to attain the happiness of the Self? are called divine,wealth.Among the divine alities? fearlessness stands foremost. Fear is an effect of ignorance. Identification with the body causes fear. Blind attachment to the body? wife? children? house or property is the cause of fear. The sge who has realised the Self is absolutely fearless.He who knows the Bliss of Brahman from which words as well as the mind turn powerless? fears nothing. (Taittiriya Upanishad)Fearlessness is the devout observance of the precepts enjoined in the scriptures without doubting. The state of being free from the fear? How can I live now when I have renounced everything? when I have none to support me is fearlessness. A Sannyasi resolves when he takes Sannyasa? I will not induce fear in any living creature. Keeping up this resolve of Abhaya Dana (gift of the boon of fearlessness to all creatures) in thought? word and deed is Abhayam or fearlessness. Fear can be removed by constant thinking of the immortal and allblissful nature of the Self. If you lead a life of honesty and truthfulness? if you devoutly observe the precepts of the scriptures without doubting? if you lead a life of right conduct? and if you remember God always? you will become fearless. When one beholds the Self only everywhere? when the sense of duality has vanished? when the sense of unity has dawned in him? how can he be afraid of anything? how can the feeling of fear arise in him Fearlessness is essential for the attainment of Moksha or salvation. Fearlessness is the chief characteristic of a liberated sage. It is the one accurate measure of ones spiritual progress. It is the cardinal virtue of an illumined sage. That is the reason why it is placed in the forefront of all divine alities. Only a liberated sage can be absolutely fearless.Sattvic Subha Vasana (good tendency) is Daivi Sampat. It induces a man to practise discrimination? dispassion? control of the mind and the senses? etc.? which help him to attain knowledge of the Self. The Rajasic and the Tamasic (Asubha or evil) Vasnas (tendencies) which operate along the currents of RagaDvesha (likes and dislikes)? which induce one to perform actions which are prohibited by the scriptures and which produce disastrous effects? constitute demoniacal nature.In Asuric nature inclination towards sensual pleasures is predominant in Rakshasic nature hatred predominates and the Rakshasa does various sorts of harm and injury to others.Good tendencies lead to Moksha. Evil tendencies lead to bondage. Good tendencies must be cultivated. Evil tendencies should be eradicated. You shoul first have a knowledge of the essential nature of these two Vasanas? if you wish to cultivate the good tendencies and eradicate the evil ones. This sixteenth discourse gives a vivid description of these tendencies.Sattvasamsuddhih Purity of understanding? cleanliness of life or purity of heart. Purity of mind? i.e.? giving up of cheating? hypocrisy? untruth and the like? in all dealings with the people? and doing transactions with perfect honesty and integrity is Sattvasamsuddhi.When the understanding abides constantly in the immortal Self and is thus firm and steadfast? you may know this to be a condition of purity. On account of purity the mind can know the Self. The state of the mind wherein it is free from doubts like Asambhavana (thought of improbability of the existence of the Self)? etc.? through hearing of the scriptures is Sattvasamsuddhi. As purity of mind cannot be obtained without devotion to the Lord? devotion is implied in these Sattvic virtues.Jnana Knowledge understanding the nature of the Self? as taught in the scriptures and by the preceptor Selfrealisation through meditation on the Great Sentence of the Upanishad. I am Brahman (Aham Brahmasmi)? is Jnana.Yoga is union of the individual soul with the Supreme Being it is the direct realisation of the Self by concentration and meditation? through selfrestraint or control of the senses. The aspirant cognises through direct perception by the inner eye of intuition or wisdom what has been learnt from the scriptures and the preceptor. The aspirant attains Selfrealisation or direct knowledge. He becomes one with Brahman -- the Absolute. He gets indirect knowledge or mere understanding or theoretical knowledge of Brahman from the scriptures. Now through the practice of Yoga he gets direct knowledge. The attempt which is favourable for the annihilation of the mind and the latent tendencies is also known as Yoga.Jnanayogavyavasthitih The state of Jivanmukti attained through Jnana Yoga? which is distinct from the state of the worldlyminded persons.Fearlessness? purity of heart and steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga are the three preeminent virtues amongst the Sattvic attributes enumerated in verses 1 to 3. They are found in Jnana Yogins only. The other alities are common to Jnana Yogins? Karma Yogins? Raja Yogins and Bhaktas. Unless you possess Sattvic virtues? you cannot practise any kind of Yoga. If you cultivate one virtue? all other virtues will cling to you by themselves. Fearlessness is the basis and foundation of the whole of mans moral structure within.Svadhyaya and Tamas constitute Kriya Yoga. Svadhyaya constitutes BrahmaYajna. Almsgiving and sacrifice pertain to Karma Yoga. Almsgiving? selfcontrol and sacrifice constitute Daivi Sampat for householders. Those alities mentioned in chapter XVI? verses 1 to 3? which belong to the aspirant who practises a particular form of Yoga constitute the Daivi Sampat of the disciple on that path.Dana Almsgiving distributing food? clothes? etc.? as far as it iles in ones power? according to ones means. A charitable man hastens to comfort the distressed and helps the needy. Charity is of three kinds? viz.? Sattvic? Rajasic and Tamasic (see chapter XVII? 20 to 22). It opens the gates of heaven. It will bring nearer the means of liberation. Just as the tree gives fruit and shade without distinction? so also give to him who needs? without distinction? with a cheerful heart.Dama Selfrestraint? selfcontrol? control of the external senses. The control of the inner senses or the mind is described in the next verse.The practice of selfcontrol annihilates the union between the senses and the sensual objects. It separates the senses from their respective objects. The aspirant will not allow the wind of the sensual objects to blow through the gateway of his senses. He keeps the senses under the strictest restraint. He lights the fire of dispassion at all the ten gates of the body. He takes rigid vows. He observes Mauna (the vow of silence) and celibacy. He is moderate in his diet. He keeps the golden medium in everything. He checks the outgoing tendencies of the mind and the senses. He induces the mind and the senses to turn backwards towards their source. Just as an enemy is cut down by means of a weapon? so also every tendency towards sensual objects is cut down by the practice of selfcontrol. All internal promptings? cravings and Vasanas should be burnt in the fire of renunciation? at the ten gates of the senses. As householders cannot practise perfect control of the senses? even moderation or regulated and disciplined life will constitute selfrestraint for them. The practice of selfcontrol includes forgiveness? harmlessness? truth? steadiness and,patience.Yajna Sacrifice. The fireworship (Agnihotra) and the like enjoined in the Vedas and also the sacrifice to the gods (DevaYajna) or worship of the gods? PitriYajna? BhutaYajna? ManushyaYajna and BrahmaYajna enjoined in the scriptures (Smritis).Svadhyaya Study of the Vedas in order to attain the unseen fruits.Tapas Austerity? moritification of the body and other forms of penance. True Tapas is meditation on the Self. It is fixing the mind on Brahman or the Self. It is to separate oneself from the physical body and the other four sheaths and to identify oneself with the Absolute. It is to turn the mind towards the soul. The three kinds of Tapas mentioned in chapter XVII? verses 14 to 16 come under this category.Arjavam Straightforwardness. This is conducive to the attainment of knowledge. The aspirant should always be candid? upright or straightforward. Straightforwardness should be his constant attitutde. A just and truthful man alone can be straightforward. He is respected by the people. He is liked by all. He attains success in all his endeavours. He never hides facts or truth.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "OMG, so like, the Lord is spilling the tea on three major vibes: godly, demon, and straight-up monster. Godly peeps are all about liberation—escaping the endless cycle of life and death. Demons? Total opposite. They're stuck in the loop, blocked from self-knowledge. It's a total spectrum, you know? Everyone's got a mix of these energies. The godly stuff—like fearlessness and purity—lifts you up. The demon vibes—lust, rage, jealousy—drag you down. It's all about leveling up your godly energy. That's the foundation of yoga. Think chill mind, selfless acts, and a burning desire for freedom. Godly peeps are humble, generous, and all about that spiritual growth. Demons? They're all about ego, fame, and self-promotion. Actions are linked to your energy. Godly energy = good actions. Demon energy = bad actions. This chapter is all about the godly vs. demon energy. Good and bad are relative, though. From a higher perspective, there's no such thing. Don't stress about the big questions of good and evil. Focus on your spiritual journey. Godly energy helps you reach self-knowledge. Fearlessness is key. Fear comes from ignorance and attachment. True fearlessness comes from knowing your true self. Purity of heart means honesty and integrity. Steadfastness in knowledge and yoga means total self-realization. Giving, self-control, and sacrifice are all about godly energy. It's about cultivating good vibes and ditching the bad ones. This chapter breaks down those vibes in detail."

The aspirant who is bent on attaining salvation marches boldly on the spiritual path. Nothing can tempt him or slacken his progress. This unbroken progress towards the realisation of the Self or the Absolute is lustre. It overcomes the downward pull of Tamas.Kshama Forgiveness. He who is endowed with this virtue does not exhibit anger even when he is insulted? ruked or beaten? although he is strong enough to take vengeance. He is unaffected by the insult or injury.Dhriti The sage absorbs within himself all calamities. He is steadfast even when he is in very adverse and trying conditions this is a particular Sattvic Vritti or state of mind which removes depression or exhaustion of the body and senses when they sink down. An aspirant who is endowed with this divine attribute never gets disheartened? even when he is under severe trials and difficulties or tribulations. Dhriti is a divine pickmeup (tonic) when the body and the senses are in a state of low spirits or dejection.Saucham Purity. This is of two kinds? viz.? external and internal. External purity is achieved by means of earth and water. The mind and heart (intellect) are freed from Maya (deception? lust? anger? greed? pride? jealousy? hypocrisy? likes and dislikes) by the practice of celibacy? forgiveness? friendliness? charity? humility? nobilit? love? complacency? compassion? etc. -- this is internal purity. This is more important than external purity.Adroha Absence of hatred? absence of desire to injure others.Atimanita is great pride. A proud man thinks that he is superior to others and that he is worthy of being honoured by others. Naatimanita is the opposite of this ality.Tejas? Kshama and Dhriti are the special alities or Dharmas of the Kshatriyas (warrior class). These are the Sattvic alities of Kshatriyas. Saucham and Adroha are the special Dharmas of the Vaisyas. They are the Sattvic alities of the Vaisyas (merchant class). Absence of pride is the special Dharma of the Sudras (servant class). It is a Sattvic ality that belongs to the Sudras.The divine wealth or Daivi Sampat consists of twentysix attributes. This is a rare gift from the Lord.

No cap, inner peace is way more important than just looking fresh. Adroha? It's about not hating on anyone. Atimanita? Yeah, that's major ego. Naatimanita? It's the opposite, no big head. Kshatriyas?

To pretend to be what one is not? to pretend to be religious and pious. It consists of bragging of ones own greatness. Religious hypocrisy is the worst form of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is a mixture of deceit and falsehood. Those who boast about their own merits will get demerit only.Darpa Arrogance. Pride of learning? wealth? high connection? etc. An arrogant man cannot endure to see his fellowmen happy. He is more and more enraged at the fortune of his fellowmen in the matter of learning? happiness and prosperity.Parushyam (in speech) To speak of the blind as having lotuslike eyes? of the ugly as beautiful? of a man of low birth as one of high birth and so on? usually with an ulterior? selfish or evil motive.Ajnanam Ignorance? misconception of ones duties. An ignorant man is blind as to what should be done and what should not be done. There is absence of discrimination. Just as a child will put anything it gets in its hands into its mouth? whether it is clean or dirty? so also is the condition of the ignorant man who is not able to discriminate between the Real and the unreal? the good and the evil? virtue and vice. He is on the path of destruction. He does not know the road that leads to Moskha or liberation. He is drowned in the ocean of this worldly existence.These are the six demonical alities. These evil alities constitute the satanic or demonical wealth. They are obstacles on the path of liberation.By addressing Arjuna as Partha? Lord Krishna implies that Arjuna has no demonical alities in him as he is born in a noble family and is the son of Pritha.People of Asuric nature have no faith. They dispute every doctrine. They deny the existence of God. They deny the cycle of the worldprocess? the Vedas and the laws of ethics. Sensual indulgence is their goal. They rob people and take away their neighbours wives. They kill people ruthlessly. They do not believe in reincarnation and in the other world. They have no idea of right conduct? purity and selfrestraint.Asuras are those persons who have waged war and who still wage war with the gods in heaven. Those who are endowed with Asuric tendencies or evil alities are Asuras or demons. They exist in abundance in this iron age. Kamsa was an Asura. Hiranyakasipu was an Asura.Even a man of university alitifactions and titles is a veritable Asura if he is endowed with evil tendencies or Asubha Vasanas.Esoterically? the war between the Asuras and the gods is the internal fight that is ever going on between the pure and the impure tendencies in man? between Sattva and RajasTamas.",

Dude, speaking straight cap, like calling a blind person's eyes 'lotus-like' or saying an ugly person is hot? That's sus. Ignorance? It's not knowing your place, not knowing what's right or wrong. It's like a toddler putting anything in their mouth, no matter how dirty. These are all major red flags, like, total demon vibes. It's a total block on your path to enlightenment.

They pose too much. They resent it much if they are belittled. The body is dearer to them than everything else. They live solely for it. If anybody tries to thwart their plans or schemes they become bitterly hostile towards him. They take vengeance on him and try to kill him mercilessly. They are extremely meanminded. Just as darness seems to be denser after night sets in? so also as their,folly increases? their arrogance grows? their egoism develops? their pride swells? and their delusion augments day by day. They use brutal force to gain their selfish ends. They abuse and illtreat all those people who are truthful and charitable? and who are devoted to Me.Ahamkaram Egoism The selfarrogating principle? the effect or modification of ignorance. This is the source of all the defects and perversities in human nature and of all evil actions. Lust? anger? greed? pride and hypocrisy are all attendants of egoism. It is very difficult to overcome this dire enemy? but through Vichara (right eniry) it can be annihilated.These Asuras who are very egoistic on account of their deep ignorance esteem themselves very highly for the alities they possess and for those which they falsely superimpose upon themselves. They think that they are very great persons on account of the good alities which they have superimposed upon themselves and their egoism is increased thery. They try to humiliate others by using their financial supremacy. They will bribe people to give false evidence and do anything to attain their selfish ends.Balam Power accompanied by lust and attachment. The Asuras use their strength of body to humiliate and destroy others. If a man is not established in Yama (the fivefold canon of ethical perfection? consisting of noninjury? truthfulness? nonstealing? celibacy and noncovetousness)? if he has no purity of heart? if his mind is surcharged or saturated with evil tendencies? and if he gets power of any sort? he will misuse or abuse it and try to humiliate or abuse others. Powers or Siddhis are bound to come if one practises concentration of mind. If he is endowed with Yama? he will never misuse them and so he will never have a downfall. That is the reason why Patanjali Maharshi says Powers are obstacles on the path of Yoga. Shun them ruthlessly. March onwards to the goal. Climb the ladder of Yoga till you attain the highest state of superconsciousness or Godconsciousness. Do not look back. Have no memories of the past.Yama is the very foundation of Yoga. Get yourself established in Yama before you take to concentration and meditation. Many aspirants get a downfall because they do not practise Yama to begin with. They jump at once to the practice of concentration and meditation. This is sad mistake.Darpa Haughtiness. A man whose heart is filled with haughtiness becomes very insolent and unjust and assumes an overbearing and domineering attitude towards others he never respects the elders? Gurus and others. This is a peculiar vice that has its seat in the mind. When this evil ality manifests itself? one swerves from the path of virtue.Krodha Anger manifests itself when one gets something unplesant and when he comes across something disagreeable.These Asuras hate Me? the Lord Who dwells in their own bodies as the silent witness of their thoughts and actions. They think that I am also a human being and hate Me. They do not understand My allpervading and imperishable nature. They do not care at all to know and follow. My ?nds or the injunctions given in the Vedas and the Smritis. If anyone violates My ?nds given in the scriptures? it is surely tantamount to an act of hatred towards Me. These people are very malicious. They have evil intentions or impure motives. They are jealous of those persons who are virtuous and who tread the path of righteousness. Their hearts burn when they notice good alities in others. This is Matsarya? a form of jealousy. If a man superimposes evil alities on a virtuous man who is endowed with good alities? this is Asuya. If his heart burns when he sees a wealthy or prosperous man? this is Irshya.",

Life's short, the scriptures are endless, and there are a million obstacles on the spiritual path. Plus, learning isn't always easy. And it's not like the scriptures always agree with each other! You said we can't get liberated without knowing the scriptures, but what about people who don't know them but still do good stuff? They do charity, rituals, worship—they're trying their best, copying what they see like a kid tracing letters or a blind person following someone who can see. What's their vibe?

Faith assumes a threefold aspect under the influence of the three alities. When Sattva is strongly developed? when there is a preponderance of Sattva or purity in a man? it is easy for him to attain Selfrealisation or the knowledge of the Self. If Rajas is predominant? the faith becomes the handmaid of activity. If Tamas or inertia prevails? faith is annihilated.Those who are endowed with Sattvic faith aim at the attainment of liberation. Those who are endowed with Rajasic faith run after inferior duties or worldly activities. Those whose faith is Tamasic are cruel. They kill animals for sacrifice. They invoke the spirits and talk with ghosts. When faith is joined to Sattva? it leads to salvation. When Rajas preponderates? it colours the faith and leads to various activities. When Tamas predominates? the faith results in darkness.Faith acires different alities when it is in company with the mind of man. Mind is a thing of many colours. Just as the water of the Ganga is contaminated by being put in a vessel where lior had been kept? so also a virtuous person is spoiled by bad company or constant association with evil persons. The three Gunas or attributes colour the faith of a man. The mind of a man is governed by the preponderating attribute or ality which manifests itself when the other two alities are suppressed. Faith takes a threefold aspect in accordance with the inherent nature or tendencies of the man. The inclinations of men are moulded according to their ality or inherent nature born of their past Samskaras.As is the tendency? so is the desire as is the desire? so is the action as is the action? so is the birth into another being after death. The body is like the seed of the tree? a perpetual chain. Seed perishes in developing into a tree and the tree again produces the seed. This process or cycle continues eternally. Even so man takes a body? does actions? develops tendencies? dies and puts,on a new body in accordance with the nature or tendencies. This continues till he gets knowledge of the Self by transcending the three Gunas? when ignorance? the root cause of birth and death? is destroyed.Faith is born of the individual nature? i.e.? the Samskaras or the latent impressions of virtuous and vicious actions which were performed in the past births and which manifested themselves at the time of death. In the subconscious mind or the Chitta there is a reservoir of past impressions which are revived through the operation of memory.Sattvic Faith in the worship of gods? which is an effect of Sattva.Rajasic Faith in the worship of the Yakshas and Rakshasas? which is an effect of Rajas.Tamasic Faith in the worship of the disembodied spirits and ghosts? which is an effect of Tamas.Faith is the main support of life. It is not mere intellectual belief or blind acceptance of pet dogmas or doctrines. You must understand clearly its characteristics? just as you recognise a tree from the fruits? the mind of a man from his speech? and the actions of previous birth from worldly pleasures and pains.Svabhavaja Inherent in their nature born of past Samskaras.Tam Of it? referring to the threefold faith.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, the whole vibe is that everyone's got this belief system, right? It's all about three main energies: sattvic (pure, chill), rajasic (go-getter, passionate), and tamasic (dark, kinda sus). If you're all about that sattvic life, you're totally on the path to self-realization. Rajasic? You're all about the hustle, chasing that clout. Tamasic? Bro, you're kinda stuck in the mud. Sattvic faith is all about liberation, rajasic is about chasing worldly stuff, and tamasic is, like, straight-up cruel. It's all about what energy is dominating your mind. It's like, your mind is a vessel, and if you hang with toxic people, you're gonna get contaminated. Your past actions shape your present vibes, and those vibes shape your future. It's a cycle, man. It's all about your past lives and the impressions they left on you. Sattvic faith is like worshipping the gods, rajasic is worshipping those mythical creatures, and tamasic is all about ghosts and spirits. Faith isn't just some blind belief; it's the foundation of your life. You gotta know what's up, you know? It's like knowing a tree by its fruit, or a person by their actions. It's all about your inherent nature, your past karma, and how that shapes your beliefs."

They do this in order to attract the people and get money for the gratification of their senses. They stand on one leg with raised hands. This is not real Tapas. This is Tamasic Tapas. Bodily torture will not bring emancipation. These men are not acainted with even the first elements of the scriptures. They mock at the religious practices of the wise? elderly persons and jeer at learned men. They are puffed up with the vanity of their own greatness. They are proud of their wealth. They perform unauthorised austerities. These persons do severe austerities contrary to the scriptures on the strength of desire and attachment.They take even the lives of children to propitiate their deity. Instead of killing their egoism? they kill many innocent animals in the name of sacrifice but in reality they kill them to satisfy their own palate. Most horrible indeed They speak ill of the scriptures and wander about in the forest of delusion and infatuation. They follow the dictates of passion. They inflict pain on themselves and on others. They practise austerities which cause pain to themselves and to other living beings. Pitiable indeed is their lot. They are doomed to destruction.Kamaragabalanvitah may also be interpreted as possessed of lust? attachment and power.Dambha Ostentation The man of Dambha is desirous that all people should take him for a virtuous man and so he expresses to others his righteous nature. In reality he is not virtuous. He pretends to be what he is not.Ahankara Egoism The egoistic man thinks and feels that he is superior to others in the possession of all virtuous alities.Raga Extreme attachment to sensual objects.Bala Great power of enduring severe pain on account of Raga for sensual objects (pain that accrues from exertion in attaining and preserving the objects).Kama Lust Desire for any object.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so some peeps think that, like, *totally* torturing their bodies is the key to, like, achieving their life goals. It's all about clout and getting that cash to, like, totally live it up. They'll stand on one leg, arms up, the whole shebang. But that's not *real* tapas, fam. That's, like, the *dark side* of tapas. Torturing yourself doesn't unlock enlightenment. These people? They don't even know the basics of the scriptures. They straight-up mock the OG religious peeps and diss the wise elders. They're all puffed up, thinking they're the bee's knees, flexing their wealth. They do these austerities that aren't even legit. They're doing extreme stuff that goes against the rules, all for their own desires and attachments. They'll even, like, *kill kids* to appease their deity. Instead of killing their ego, they kill innocent animals for their own selfish reasons. It's totally messed up. They trash talk the scriptures and wander around lost in their own delusions. They're all about following their passions, hurting themselves and others. Their austerities hurt them and everyone around them. It's a total L. They're totally doomed."

You can find out your own nature? whether you are Sattvic? Rajasic or Tamasic? from your predilection to particular food and then abandon the Rajasic and the Tamasic foodstuffs and take to the Sattvic diet.Why is there also a triple division in sacrifice? austerity and charity Because this threefold division is according to the nature of the Gunas.

The body is used in the service of the parents and preceptors? the poor and the sick. This is also bodily austerity. That austerity which is done by the body is physical austerity. The physical body is the chief agent in doing such austerity. Hence this is called physical austerity. The practice of nonstealing and noncovetousness are also included in physical austerity.He who has realised I am Brahman is a wise man (Prajna). A Sudra also may be a wise man. Though Vidura was a Sudra he was a sage. That is the reason why the Lord has made a separate mention of the wise.Brahmacharya means control but not suppression of the sexdesire or sexforce. If the mind is filled with sublime thoughts by meditation? Japa (repetition of a Mantra)? prayer? study of holy scriptures? eniry of Who am I? and contemplation of the sexless? pure Self? the sexdesire will be devitalised by the withdrawal of the mind. The mind also will be thinned out. Suppressed sexdesire will attack you again and again and will produce wetdreams? irritability and restlessness of the mind. The mind should be rendered pure by meditation? Japa? singing of the Lords names? and prayer. The mind should be controlled first. Then it will be easy for you to control the senses. That is the reason why the practice of Sama or the control of the mind comes first and then comes Dama or the restraint of the senses (in the order of the sixfold virtues. The senses cannot operate without the help of the mind. So the effective remedy for lust and the best aid to celibacy is to control the mind first and then the senses.Intense musing on the objects of the senses does more harm to the inner spiritual life than actual sensegratification. If the mind is not rendered pure by Sadhana? mere mortification of the external senses will not produce the desired effect. Although the external senses are mortified? their internal counterparts which are still energetic and vigorous? revenge upon the mind? and produce intense mental disturbance and wild imagination.To control the mind is diffcult for neophytes or the beginners. It will be extremely difficult to control the mind first when the senses are allowed to run riot. That is the reason why Lord Krishna says Therefore? O Arjuna? mastering first the senses? do thou slay this thing of sin (desire)? destructive of wisdom and knowledge. (Cf.III.41)The theory or doctrine that the mind should be controlled first is ite correct. This practice is intended for the firstclass type of spiritual aspirants. The middling type of students should control the senses first. The senses always have an outgoing tendency. The mind operates through the senses. Control of the one goes hand in hand with control of the other. Control of the senses is also control of the mind? because the mind is a bundle of senses only there is no mind without the senses.Just as an enemy can be easily conered if you have a twopronged attack? so also the mind can be controlled easily if you attack it on two fronts simultaneously -- an external attack on the senses and an internal attack on the mind itself by the eradication of the desires.To say? Control the mind first? you can control the senses (which is one point of view) or Control the senses first? you can control the mind easily (which is another point of view) is simply arguing in a vicious circle like Which came first -- the tree or the seed or You will get the knowledge of the Self if you control all desires -- and you can control all the desires only if you have knowledge of the Self.You need not worry yourself over this seeming paradox. Try to do either of the practices? viz.? control of the mind or control of the senses? according to your liking? capacity? taste and temperament. You can yourself find out by actual practice which is better. As you advance in your practice your doubtwill gradually disapperar and you will enjoy supreme peace and joy.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, \"tapas,\" or self-discipline? It's all about using your body to, like, *actually* serve. Think pilgrimages, cleaning temples, doing all the worship stuff, showing mad respect to Brahmins and wise peeps, and, like, total chill with the whole celibacy and non-violence thing. It's also about helping your fam, teachers, the poor, and sick peeps. No stealing or being greedy either. A \"wise person\"? Anyone can be one, even if they're not, like, super high up in the caste system. Brahmacharya? It's not about, like, *suppressing* your desires, it's about, like, *redirecting* your energy.

They gotta be legit – a total guru, super pious, knows their scriptures, can protect themselves and you, etc. It's all about giving to someone who's, like, the epitome of purity and good vibes. And don't go bragging about it, bro."

Om is the Akshara Brahman. Tat means Thath? the indefinable. Sat means Reality.Para Brahman? that Supreme Being? the abiding place of all that lives and moves? is beyond name and class. The Vedas have ventured to give a name to Him. A new born child has no name but no,receiving one he will answer to it. Men who are troubled by the afflictions of this world run to the Deity for refuge and call Him by the name. When Brahman is invoked through the name that which is hidden is revealed to the aspirant.These three words have a divine power of their own. The vibrations that they produce in one are such as to arouse the latent divinity and also to secure the necessary response from the Cosmic Being Whom they connote.When a sacrificial rite or the like is found defective? it will be rendered perfect by the utterance of the powerful Mantra Om Tat Sat or one of the three designations in the end. With Om or Om Tat Sat all acts of sacrifice? study of sacred scriptures? spiritual discipline and meditation are commenced. If the doer of sacrifices remembers either of these Mantras all obstacles that stand in the way of success of the sacrifices are removed.Om Tat Sat has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman in the Vedanta by the knowers of Brahman. The power of creation that lies in the Creator emanates from this Mantra. When He meditated inwardly on the meaning of this Mantra and repeated the threefold word? He acired the power to create. Then He created the Brahmanas? gave them the Vedas to be their guide and directed them to perform sacrifices and other rites.Puraa Of old At the beginning of creation by the Prajapati.Brahman here means the Veda.",

'Tat' is that which is beyond definition, that which cannot be put into words. And 'Sat' is pure, unadulterated reality. The Supreme Being, the ultimate source of everything, is beyond labels and categories. But, like, the Vedas tried to give it a name, you know? It's like, a newborn baby doesn't have a name, but once they get one, they respond to it. People who are, like, totally stressed out about life, they call out to the Divine, they give it a name. When you call out to Brahman using this name, it's like, the hidden stuff gets revealed. These three words have, like, major power. The vibes they give off awaken your inner divinity and get a response from the Cosmic Being. If a ritual or something is, like, totally messed up, saying 'Om Tat Sat' fixes it. You start all your rituals, studying, meditating, everything with 'Om' or 'Om Tat Sat'. If you remember these mantras while doing rituals, all the obstacles disappear. 'Om Tat Sat' is the ultimate three-word description of Brahman, according to the OG Brahman experts. The power of creation comes from this mantra. When the Creator meditated on it, they got the power to create everything. Then they created the Brahmanas, gave them the Vedas as their guide, and told them to do all the rituals and stuff. 'Pura' means way back when, at the very beginning of creation."

It does not mean nonexistence as such.Acts of sacrifice? austerity and gift that are performed without faith? under pressure? or to prevent some sort of trouble or to gratify a craving? are Asat in their nature. They yield no permanent benefit or fruit to anybody.Any sacrifice? austerity or gift done without dedicating it to the Lord will be of no avail to the doer in this earthly life here or in the life beyond hereafter. It would be as useless as showers of rain falling on rocky ground or pouring oblations of ghee (clarified butter) on cold ashes. If you have no faith you will become egoistic and obstinate. Your heart will become hard. If you perform even hundreds of sacrifices without faith? without the spirit of selfsurrender to the Lord? even if you distribute the wealth of the whole world in charity without faith in and devotion to the Lord? all these would be worthless and useless. The sages will not appreciate such sacrifices or gifts. Energy? money and time are simply wasted.Thus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita? the science of the Eternal? the scripture of Yoga? the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna? ends the seventeenth discourse entitledThe Yoga of the Division of the Threefold Faith. ,",

    "chapter_summary": "The eighteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is \"Moksha Sanyas Yoga\". Arjuna requests the Lord to explain the difference between the two types of renunciations - sanyaas(renunciation of actions) and tyaag(renunciation of desires). Krishna explains that a sanyaasi is one who abandons family and society in order to practise spiritual discipline whereas a tyaagi is one who performs their duties without attachment to the rewards of their actions and dedicating them to the God. Krishna recommends the second kind of renunciation - tyaag. Krishna then gives a detailed analysis of the effects of the three modes of material nature. He declares that the highest path of spirituality is pure, unconditional loving service unto the Supreme Divine Personality, Krishna. If we always remember Him, keep chanting His name and dedicate all our actions unto Him, take refuge in Him and make Him our Supreme goal, then by His grace, we will surely overcome all obstacles and difficulties and be freed from this cycle of birth and death.",
    "chapter_summary_hindi": "भगवद गीता का अठारहवा अध्याय मोक्षसन्यासयोग है। अर्जुन कृष्ण से अनुरोध करते हैं कि वे संन्यास और त्याग के बीच अंतर को समझाने की कृपा करें। कृष्ण बताते हैं कि एक संन्यासी वह है जो आध्यात्मिक अनुशासन का अभ्यास करने के लिए परिवार और समाज को त्याग देता है जबकि एक त्यागी वह है जो अपने कर्मों के फलों कि चिंता करे बिना भगवन को समर्पित करके कर्म करता रहता है। कृष्ण बताते हैं कि त्याग संन्यास से श्रेष्ठ है। फिर कृष्णा भौतिक संसार के तीन प्रकार के गुणों का विस्तारपूर्वक वर्णन करते हैं। कृष्णा घोषणा करते हैं कि परमात्मा की शुद्ध एवं सत्य भक्ति ही आध्यात्मिकता का उच्चतम मार्ग है। अगर हम हर क्षण उनका स्मरण करते रहें, उनका नाम जपते रहें, अपना सर्वस्व उनको समर्पित कर दें, उन्हें ही अपना सर्वोच्च लक्ष्य बना लें तो उनकी कृपा से हम निश्चित रूप से सभी बाधाओं और कठिनाइओं को दूर कर पाएंगे और इस जन्म और मृत्यु के चक्र से मुक्त हो पाएंगे।",

Do it without expecting anything back, no strings attached, and you're good. No cap. When you're not chasing rewards, you're leveling up your mind, getting rid of the negative vibes (Rajas and Tamas), and filling yourself with good energy (Sattva). It's all about selflessness and making the right choices. This is how you break free from the cycle of Karma. Basically, Krishna is dropping some serious truth about letting go (verse 4), then he's straight up saying, don't quit on the sacrifices, charity, and austerities; they're purifying. Even these actions should be performed without attachment, etc. It's the conclusion of what he said in verse 4. 'Even' means that even tho these things can bind you if you're attached to the rewards, you still gotta do them. It's like, scorched seeds can't grow, right?

When you do your thing without being attached or selfish, your mind gets purified, and you're ready for some serious self-discovery. It's like, leveling up your spiritual game. To reach enlightenment, you gotta be ready to suffer a little, physically. Self-discipline and sacrifice? Yeah, that's gonna sting sometimes. The Gita's main point?

He is not affected by either pleasure or pain. He is not elated at performing pleasant actions nor does he find unpleasantness when he does disagreeable actions. He does not hate the latter? nor is he attached to the former. Neither has he aversion to painful actions nor attraction to pleasant ones. As he has no attachment to any action or its rewards? he will do any action for the welfare of all beings.Akusalam Karma Disagreeable work or work done with expectation of reward? which becomes the cause of bondage to Samsara? by producing a body. He does not hate an unpleasnt action? thinking? Of what use is itKusale To good ones which include obligatory daily duties. He has no attachment to them even with the notion that they lead to salvation by purifying the heart and conseently giving rise to the dawn of knowledge and devotion to it.When one abandons attachment to action and desire for its reward and performs actions vigorously? his heart is filled with Sattva or purity which produces discrimination between the Real and the unreal? the Eternal and the transient. Then he attains knowledge of the Self which dispels all the doubts caused by ignorance. He now realises that the only means of attaining the spureme bliss or eternal peace or immortality is knowledge of the Self. This rends asunder all his doubts. What is the nature of doubt Does Brahman exist or not Do the Upanishads deal with Saguna Brahman or Nirguna Brahman Is the individual soul identical with the Supreme Being or not Will I be able to realise the Self or not Will any of the Karmas (Prarabdha? Sanchita and Agami) affect me Does this Samsara whose nature is the feelings I do this and I enjoy this belong to the Self or to the mind and intellect What are the means for liberation -- Yoga? devotion? Karma or knowledge of the Self What is Moksha Is it Selfrealisation or the attainment of the Salokya? Samipya? Sarupya and Sayujya states (dwelling in the kingdom of God? proximity to Him? assuming the same form as the Lord and merging in Him)When a man practises Karma Yoga he gets purity of heart and through purity of heart knows himself to be the immutable actionless Self Who is destitute of birth? or remains without acting or causing others to act (Cf.V.13). He attains devotion to the knowledge of the Self and freedom from all actions. The purpose of the Karma Yoga described above has been taught in this verse.Medhavi He who is endowed or united with wisdom. He is a Sthitaprajna. What is Medha? then It is the immediate knowledge of the identity of the individual soul and the Supreme Being by meditation on the right significance of the great sentence (I am Brahman or That thou art)? which,is free from the three kinds of doubts? viz.? Samsaya Bhavana (doubt)? Asambhavana (improbability) and Viparitabhavana (perversion)? and by the practice of the four means and service of the Guru (who is versed in the scriptures and established in Brahman) and hearing the truths from him.Such a Medhavi will not think that prohibited actions which bind an ignorant man will be unfavourable to him. He will never think that they will bind him if he has to perform them? because he is above good and evil? virtue and vice? right and wrong. He has no idea of agency (Kartritva Abhimana) he feels that he is a Kritakritya? one who has accomplished all actions.This does not mean that he will do wrong actions. As his will is one with the cosmic will? whatever action he performs will be in accordance with the scriptures. He will never deviate even a fraction of an inch from the rules of the scriptures. The Lord alone works through his mind and senses as he has no individual will.RagaDvesha (likes and dislikes) are the motives that induce a worldly man to actions. As they are absent in a sage or a Medhavi? he can renounce the fruits of all actions and actions as well.As the ocean remains calm amidst stormy waves? even so a Sattvic man remains calm amidst adverse or stormy conditions of life. He recognises that the happenings of life are inevitable. He acts in a variety of ways but is not disturbed as he has a balanced and disciplined mind.There must be no hatred for unpleasant or disagreeable action that brings physical suffering? danger or unlucky results or untoward conseences? when it is the work that should be done. You will have to accept such work also with a willing heart and work with hear and soul. You must have a profound and comprehensive understanding of its need and meaning also. Arjuna failed to understand in the beginning the deep significance and need of the work given by the Lord. He brought in his own foolish philosophy. He failed to do his bounden duty because? due to ignorance? he thought it was an unpleasant or disagreeable action to kill people but in the end when his eyes were opened by the valuable teachings of the Lord? he understood the need and the meaning of the work although it appeared to him as disagreeable and unpleasant in the beginning? and said My illusion is destroyed. I have gained knowledge through Thy grace? O Krishna. I am firm? my doubts are gone. I will act according to Thy instructions.",

Nature does actions but through delusion the individual soul takes to himself the credit of their execution and? therefore? he is called the agent.Karta The enjoyer putting on the nature or properties of the limiting adjuncts with which he comes into contact.Karanam prithagvidham Various organs such as the organ of hearing? by which the individual soul hears the sound? etc. organs of knowledge and action and the mind.Daivam The presiding deity such as the Sun and the other gods by whose help the eye and the other organs perform their respective functions destiny.Cheshta Play of energy in the organs or the senses during the action.Absence of any of these factors will make action impossible.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, here's the lowdown on these five things. First up, the body—it's, like, the main base, the vibe check. It's where all the feels live, you know? Happiness, sadness, that whole shebang. The soul, it's all about experiencing stuff through the body. Then there's the ego, the 'doer,' the one taking credit for everything. It's like, the soul's all, 'I did that!' even though it's really nature doing its thing. Next, we got the senses—hearing, seeing, all that. And finally, the presiding deity, like the sun and other gods, making sure everything runs smoothly. It's all about the energy flow, the synergy. If any of these are missing, nothing's happening."

He is unattached like ether. He is always the silent witness. He is the spectator of activity. The egoistic man of little understanding only thinks that he is the real agent? and so he is bound by actions. He takes birth again and again to reap the fruits of his actions. For him who considers the body as consciousness? God or the Self? it naturally follows that the Self is the agent or the doer. He who identifies himself with the body? who has taken the body as the pure Self? has cast a net over himself? and he leads a deluded life of utter ignorance. He is bound by the fetters or bonds of Karma. He is ever shut up in the prisonhouse of this body.He who has not united himself with the Buddhi? who has got an impure or untrained understanding? who regards the Self as the actor or the agent is certainly a man of perverted intelligence. He is deluded. He is really a blind man. He sees not though he has eyes. He does not behold the essence of things. He has no idea of the supreme Principle (the Self) Which is Itself actionless? Which ever stands as a silent witness of the activities of all minds and all organs of all beings? Which moves the minds? organs and the lifeforce and the bodies to action? just as the magnet makes the iron pieces move. He does not behold the truth about the Self and action.Durmati Evilminded person A man of perverted intellect or undeveloped reason. He thinks that he alone is the doer or agent. He does not understand anything. He has no knowledge of the,actionless? pure? selfluminous Self.The ignorant man of untrained understanding identifies himself with the five causes and regards the pure actionless Self as the agent or doer of the actions which are really done by these five causes. What is the reason for this Why does he regard them so Because he is not endowed with a pure and subtle intellect his understanding (Buddhi) has not been trained in the practice of Vedanta he is not eipped with the four means of salvation his intellect has not been trained by the teachings of the preceptor or the spiritual teacher in the methods of logical reasoning.He who considers that the pure actionless Self is the agent or the doer is certainly a man of untrained understanding. He has no knowledge of the actionless Self and action. Therefore? he is a man of perverted intelligence. His intellect works or moves in the wrong direction. His intellect moves in the sensual grooves or avenues. It runs like the vicious horse and leads to birth and death. The technie of Buddhi Yoga taught in the Gita enables one effectively to prevent this.He does not perceive or cognise the Truth though he has eyes. Though he sees? he sees the external? gross? illusory? everchanging? perishable objects only. He does not behold the one immortal? unchanging? allblissful essence? which is the basis or substratum of everything. He is like the man with jaundiced eyes? who sees all objects tinged with yellow colur? or like the man suffering from diplopia who beholds many moons? or like the man who thinks that the moon moves when the clouds move? or like the man who? seated in a train? imagines that the trees are moving when it is the train that is really moving.

O Arjuna? the characterisitics of the man who has transcended activity? and who has gone beyond the bonds of Karma.When selfishnes and egoism are destroyed? when desire and personal gain are renounced? actions cannot bind a man. He knows that the Self is not destroyed when the body perishes. He has no idea of agency. The act of killing itself? in his case? becomes one necessary for the peace and harmony of the world. His killing without desire is like the killing of a murderer by the executioner and the judge on behalf of the community for the preservation of peace and harmony in the world.He who has a trained intellect? pure understanding and developed reason? who has a knowledge of the scriptures? who has devoted himself to the study of the scriptures? who is eipped with the knowledge of logic? who is well trained by the instructions of his preceptor? is absolutely free from the egoistic notion that I am the agent or the doer. He knows perfectly well that Nature or Guna or ones own nature does everything. He thus thinks I am the silent witness of all activities. I am not the doer. These five (the body? the actor? etc.) which are superimposed on the pure? actionless Self through ignorance are the causes of all actions. I do not do anything. The senses move amongst the senseobjects. The alities (Gunas) move in their counterparts in the senses which are also the products of the Gunas. I know the essence of the divisions of the alities and their functions. I am in essence without limbs. How can action or work be ascribed to me I am without hands? without legs? without feet? without breath and without mind. I am ever pure? spotless and immovable and immutable. He will never repent thus I have done a wrong action. I ought to have done like this. I have done an evil action. I will go to hell. He is always wise. He can,never do a wrong action. His will has become one with the cosmic will. His will has become blended with the will of the Lord. Whatever he does is done by the Lord only. He has no will of his own. He sees rightly. Though he kills? he does not commit the act of killing. He is not bound by the fruit of a vicious action as an effect of that act. He is beyond good and evil? beyond the pairs of opposites? as he has knowledge of the Self.An objector says The statement that though he kills these people? he does not kill? is selfcontradictory.We say This objection is really not tenable. From the worldly point of view the Lord says though he kills? because man identifies the Self with the body? etc.? and thinks I am the killer. From the transcendental point of view explained above? the Lord says? He kills not? he is not bound.Another objector says The Self acts in conjunction with the body? etc.? -- He who looks upon his Self Which is isolated? as the agent৷৷.  (XVIII.16)We say This objection also cannot stand. As the omnipresent ether is not affected by reason of its subtlety? even so the Self? seated everywhere in the body? is not affected. This immortal? immutable? changeless? formless? attributeless Self? though seated in the body? does not act and is not affected? just as the crystal is not affected by the red colour of the flower that comes into contact with it? just as the sun is not affected by the diseases of the eye. A thing that changes only can join with others and become the agent. The Self is always isolated? independent and free. This Self is immutable (II.25). The alities move amidst the alities (III.28). Though seated in the body? He does not act (XIII.31). Actions are wrought by the alities (III.27). You will find in the Brihadaranyaka were. By reasoning also we may establish the same conclusion thusThe Self is indivisible? allpervading? infinite? limbless? without parts? independent? ever free and immutable. Therefore the actions of the body can never be ascribed to the agency of the Self.Verily the actions of one cannot go to another who has not done them. Just as blue colour cannot belong to the sky? silver to the motherofpearl? water to mirage? so also what is ascribed to the Self by ignorance cannot really belong to It. The changes that occur in the body pertain to the body but not to the pure actionless Self which is always the spectator or the silent witness. Therefore? it is right to say that the wise man who is free from egoism and all impurities of the mind? neither kills nor is he bound though he kills.In chapter II.19? the Lord stated the proposition -- He slayeth not? nor is he slain. In chapter II.20? He said The Self is unborn? eternal? ancient the Self is not slain when the body is killed. The Lord has touched here and there that the Self is not affected by works? that there is no necessity for the wise man of doing actions. He concludes that the sage kills not? nor is he bound? and sums up the teaching of the Gita. The teaching of the Gita has been concluded in this verse. The Sannyasins who are free from egoism are not affected by Karma. The threefold fruits of action? viz.? evil? good and mixed (see verse 12 above) do not accrue to them. Those worldlyminded persons who work with egoism and expectation of fruits are tainted by the works. They are forced to experience the fruits of their actions and to take birth again and again. (Cf.II.19V.7)",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so Arjuna, lemme break down this whole 'no cap' vibe of someone who's totally transcended the drama of karma. When you ditch the ego and that whole 'me, me, me' thing, desires and personal gain are, like, *so* last season. Actions? They can't even touch you. This person knows their true self isn't gonna get erased when their body kicks the bucket. They're not even tripping about who's doing what. Killing? For them, it's just another Tuesday, necessary for world peace and harmony. It's like, the executioner doing their job, no biggie. If you're intellectually woke, with pure understanding and logic on lock, and you've been hitting the books (scriptures, yo!), you're totally free from that 'I'm the doer' ego trip. You know nature's running the show. You're just the chill observer, not the main character. Those five things (body, actor, etc.)? They're just illusions, man. The senses are vibing with the sense objects, the gunas are doing their thing. You're the essence, no limbs, no hands, no nothing. How can you even *do* anything? You're pure, unbothered, and unchanging. No regrets, no 'shoulda, woulda, coulda.' You're wise AF. You can't even *do* wrong. Your will is one with the cosmic will, it's all the Lord's doing. You see clearly. Even if you kill, you're not *actually* killing. You're not bound by the consequences. You're beyond good and evil, you get it. Someone might be like, 'Wait, killing but not killing? That's sus!' But nah, it's all about perspective. Worldly view? Yeah, they're killing. Transcendental view? Nah, they're not even involved. Another objection might be like, 'The self acts with the body, right?' But that's wrong. The self is like the ether, super subtle, unaffected. It's unchanging, formless, attributeless. It's like a crystal not changing color because a red flower is near it. Only things that change can be agents. The self is always isolated, independent, free. Actions are done by the gunas, not the self. The self is indivisible, all-pervading, infinite, limbless, without parts, independent, ever-free, and immutable. So, actions of the body can't be blamed on the self. It's like, blue can't belong to the sky, silver to mother-of-pearl, water to a mirage. What ignorance assigns to the self doesn't actually belong there. Changes in the body are body things, not self things. The self is just watching. So, yeah, the wise person, free from ego and mind junk, doesn't kill, and isn't bound, even if they do kill. It's all about that self-knowledge. The Gita's whole point is that the self isn't affected by actions. The wise person doesn't need to act. They don't kill, and they're not bound. Sannyasins, those who are free from ego, aren't affected by karma. The fruits of actions? They don't even touch them. But those who are all about the ego and expecting results? They're stuck in the cycle of rebirth."

Kshatriyas and Vaisyas are alified to practise the Vedic rites. The members of the fourth class?

I will now explain the specific duties of these castes according to the alities by means of which? freeing themselves from the grip of birth and death? they can attain Selfrealisation or knowledge of the Self. Passion (Rajas) slightly mingled with Tamas causes the growth of the merchant caste (the Vaisya). Rajas mixed with Tamas is the cause of the appearance of the Sudra.The one human race has been divided into four castes based upon the three alities. The duties are allotted to each according to the alities born of Nature.Nature (Svabhava) is Isvaras Prakriti (Maya) constituted of the three alities -- Sattva? Rajas and Tamas.The Brahmanas nature is Sattva. So he is serene. The nature of the Kshatriya is Rajas and Sattva. Sattva in his case is subordinate to Rajas. Rajas predominates. Therefore he possesses lordliness. The nature of the Vaisya is Rajas and Tamas. Tamas is subordinate to Rajas. So he does various sorts of activities or business to earn money. The nature of the Sudra is Tamas? with subordinate Rajas. He is dull.Karma is action arising from and fashioned by past thoughts and desires. The Gunas cannot manifest themselves without a cause. Nature is the tendency? Samskara or Vasana in living beings. This is acired by them in the past births. This manifests itself in the present birth and produces its effects. This nature is the source of the Gunas. Every man or woman is born with his or her own Svabhava (nature). The Gunas operate according to the respective natural tendencies of man which impel him to perform his own duties as their natural effects. The duties are allottted to the four classes or castes in accordance with the Gunas of individuals. (Cf.IV.13)",

They're totally grounded in their true self, which is all about existence, knowledge, and bliss. This person, who's got that self-knowledge, achieves ultimate perfection – total freedom from action through letting go. Ignorance is gone, replaced by self-knowledge, and actions just stop mattering. They might still do stuff for the world, but they're not bound by it because they're totally free. The fire of knowledge has burned away the consequences of their actions. They don't even think of themselves as the 'doer' because they're totally free of ego, totally one with the Supreme Being. Naishkarmya siddhi? That's like, the ultimate state of being – no action, just pure divine awesomeness. It's like instant liberation, total chill. You get there through letting go, through knowledge, or by just dropping all actions once you've got that self-knowledge. Mentally letting go of everything, totally self-controlled, they're just vibing in their own little world, not doing anything, not making anyone else do anything. The Lord's next lesson is about how to get to that perfect freedom from action by serving the Lord, getting that discernment, meditating constantly, and chilling in the knowledge of your unchanging self."

The spiritual vibrations in solitude are wonderfully elevating. Meditation will come by itself without exertion. All saints and sages who have attained Selfrealisation have remained in solitude for a number of years. You will have good meditation if you sit on the bank of a river? in a cave or on the seashore or in a jungle. During the Christmas and Easter holidays you can all enjoy the peace of solitude. It is very necessary to live in solitude at least for a month or a fortnight in a year for the householders. Instead of wasting time? energy and money in Calcutta or any other city? during the holidays? live in holy places like Rishikesh? Uttarakasi or Naimisaranya drink the nectar of peace in such places by doing Anushthana (intense and systematic spiritual practice) or Japa of a Mantra and attain immortality. If you once taste the bliss of solitude you will never forget it. Every year you will attempt to taste it again. He who takes too much food (a glutton) is ite unfit for meditation or the spiritual path. Too much food will produce laziness? a halfsleepy state and deep sleep also. Eat to live. Eat in moderation. You will have a light body and light? cheerful and serene mind. This will help you in your practice of meditation. Observe Mauna or the vow of silelnce for a week or a month. Observe the vow for two hours daily. Control the body. Practise Ahimsa and Brahmacharya. Meditate on the Self or on the Lord Hari with four hands? or on Lord Krishna? Rama or Siva. Be regular in your meditation and gradually increase the period of meditation from 15 minutes to 3 or 6 hours at a sitting. If you are a wholetimed aspirant? spend the whole time in meditation. If you are not able to do this? do Likhita Japa (writing the Mantra) and Kirtan (singing the Names and glories of the Lord). Study religious books in the interval. Only advanced aspirants can meditate for a long time. Watch the mind and cultivate dispassion. Energy will leak out through the senses if you are careless and nonvigilant. If energy leaks out? you cannot have good meditation. Dispassion is indifference to sensual enjoyments herein and hereafter? absence of desire for visible and invisible objects. You must have steady? lasting and sustained dispassion. It should not wane. It should be a constant attitude of the mind. You must be fully established in dispassion.In doing the Anushthana for 40 days live on milk and fruits or light diet. Take only 3 or 4 articles of food. Take one meal only. Sleep on the floor. Observe celibacy and the vow of silence. Do not come out of the room. Speak little if you do not observe perfect silence. Do the Anushthana on the banks of the Ganga or any sacred river. Try to do one or several Purascharanas of your Ishta Mantra. If there are five letters (syllables in English) in the Mantra? 500?000 repetitions of the Mantra will constitute one Purascharana.",

Stuffing your face makes you sluggish, and that's a major meditation buzzkill. Eat to live, not the other way around. Silence is golden. Try a week-long mute challenge, or even just a couple of hours a day. Control your body, be chill, and meditate on whatever deity you're into. Start small, like 15 minutes, and work your way up. If you're fully committed, go all in. If not, write mantras or sing along to bops. Read some spiritual stuff, too. Only the pros can meditate for hours. Watch your mind, and let go of attachments. If you're not focused, your energy leaks, and meditation goes out the window. Dispassion is about not being obsessed with stuff, now or later. It's a constant state of mind. For a serious spiritual cleanse, do a 40-day challenge: milk, fruit, one meal a day, floor sleeping, celibacy, and silence. Find a sacred spot, and repeat your mantra like, a million times. It's a whole thing."

His attainment of perfect freedom or oneness with the Supreme is described in the next verse.He is tranilminded. He is in a state of balance and eanimity. There is nothing connected with the little personality that may cause him to grieve or prompt him to feel desire. When this state is attained? the multiplicity of objects gradually disappears and he perceives only unity everywhere. The waking and dream consciousness that gives rise to false knowledge gradually passes away.He does not grieve about his bodily wants. If he fails in his attempt to fulfil them? he does not grieve either. He always keeps evenness of mind in success and failure. He has no longing for any object that is not attained.Na sochati na kankshati can also be interpreted as he neither grieves nor exults.Samah sarveshu bhuteshu may also mean he puts himself in the position of others and feels for others. If anyone is in acute agony or distress? he himself feels that he is affected. His heart is very tender and soft. He is extremely compassionate and merciful. He considers that the pleasure and pain of all beings are his own. If others rejoice he also rejoices if others are in distress? he also is distressed. His heart is so much expanded that he feels for all. Jealousy? narrowness of heart? pettymindedness? the idea of separateness? all barriers that separate man from man? prejudices of all sorts and dislike for others -- all vanished in toto. He has cosmic love. He is a cosmic benefactor. He is the friend of all. This state of expansion is beyond description. One has to experience it for oneself. Such a devotee or aspirant attains supreme devotion to Me? the fourth or the highest of the four kinds of devotion mentioned in verse 16 of chapter VII? viz.? devotion of knowledge of the man of wisdom.

It's all unity, man. No more waking-up-and-dreaming-false-reality stuff. They don't even sweat the small stuff, like, not getting what they want. Win or lose, they're totally even-keeled. No desires, no longing. It's also like, they don't get super hyped or bummed out about anything. 'Samah sarveshu bhuteshu'? They're walking in other people's shoes, feeling their pain. Super empathetic, you know? Like, if someone's hurting, they're hurting. Total compassion. It's all about cosmic love, being a total bro to everyone. No jealousy, no hate, no judgment. It's this huge, expansive love, you can't even describe it, you gotta experience it. And that's how you get supreme devotion to Krishna, the highest level, the wisdom-knowledge type of devotion, you know? (Check out chapter 2, verse 70 for more on that.)"

O Arjuna? who has attained to union with Me through singleminded and unflinching devotion is verily My very Self. Devotion culminates in knowledge. Devotion begins with two and ends in one. ParaBhakti (supreme devotion) and Jnana are one. Devotion is the mother. Knowledge is the son. By devotion he knows that I am allpervading pure,consciousness he knows that I am nondual? unborn? decayless? causeless? selfluminous? indivisible? unchanging he knows that I am destitute of all the differences caused by the limiting adjuncts he knows that I am the support? source? womb? basis? and substratum of everything he knows that I am the ruler of all beings he knows that I am the Supreme Purusha? the controller of Maya? and that this world is a mere appearance. Thus knowing Me in truth or in essence? he enters into Me soon after attaining Selfknowledge.The act of knowing and the act of entering are not two distinct acts. Knowing is becoming. Knowing is attaining Selfknowledge. To know That is to become That. Entering is knowing or beoming That. Entering is the attainment of Selfknowledge or Selfrealisation. These are all jugglery of words only. Knowing and entering are synonymous terms. It is very difficult to understand or comprehend transcendental spiritual matters. The teachers use various terms or expressions? analogies? similes? parables? stories? etc. to make the aspirant grasp the matter clearly and lucidly. Words are imperfect and languages are defective. They cannot fully express the inner spiritual experiences. The teacher somehow or other expresses to the students or aspirants these spiritual ideas. The aspirant himself will have to realise the Self. That is beyond the reach of words of expressions or analogies of similes. How can there be similes for that nondual Brahman These words are a sort of help or prop for the aspirants to lean upon in the beginning to understand spiritual matters. When he realises the Self? these words are of no value to him. He himself becomes an embodiment of knowledge.",
        "commentary_gen_z_translation": "Okay, so like, my devotee, Arjuna, who's, like, totally vibing with me through, like, hardcore devotion—that's, like, *me*. Devotion? It's like, the OG, then knowledge is like, the next level. It starts with two things, but ends with one. Supreme devotion and knowledge are, like, totally one and the same. Devotion's the mom, knowledge is the kid. Through devotion, you get that I'm everywhere, pure consciousness, non-dual, unborn, undying, no cause, self-lit, indivisible, unchanging, and totally free of all that limiting stuff. You get that I'm the support, source, womb, base, and everything of everything. I'm the boss of all beings, the Supreme Dude, the controller of Maya, and this world is just, like, an illusion. So, knowing me for real, you're, like, instantly in me. It's not two separate things, knowing and entering. Knowing *is* becoming. Knowing is self-knowledge. To know That is to become That. Entering is knowing, or becoming That. It's self-knowledge, self-realization. It's all wordplay, tbh. Knowing and entering are the same thing. Spiritual stuff is hard to grasp, so teachers use analogies, stories, whatever to help you get it. Words are weak, languages are weak, they can't fully explain spiritual experiences. Teachers try their best, but you gotta realize it yourself. It's beyond words. How can you even use similes for the one true Brahman? These words are just training wheels. Once you get it, you don't need them anymore. You become knowledge itself."

I am Thy disciple? suppliant to Thee teach me.All Dharmas Righteous deeds? including Adharma all actions? righteous or unrighteous? as absolute freedom from all actions is intended to be taught here.Taking refuge in Me alone implies the knowledge of unity without any thought of duality knowing that there is nothing else except Me? the Self of all? dwelling the same in all. If thou art established in this faith? I shall liberate thee from all sins? from all bonds of Dharma and Adharma by manifesting Myself as thy own Self.To behold forms is the Dharma of the eye. The support or substratum of all forms is Brahman. When you look at an object behold Brahman Which is the one essence and abandon the form as it is illusory and unreal. Have the same attitude towards the other objects which pertain to the other senses.Give up the JivaDharma (the notions I am the doer o actions? I enjoy. I am a Brahmana. I am a Brahmachari. I am endowed with a little knowledge and power? etc. and get yourself established in BrahmaBhavana (the understanding or knowledge I am Brahman). This is what is meant by taking refuge in Lord Krishna? according to the Vedantins.Work ceaselessly for the Lord but surrender the fruits of all actions to the Lord. Take the Lord as your sole refuge. Live for Him. Work for Him. Serve Him in all forms. Think of Him only. Meditate on Him alone. See Him in all forms. Think of Him only. Meditate on Him alone. See Him everywhere. Worship Him in your heart. Consecrate your life? all actions? feelings and thoughts to the Lord. You will rest in Him. You will attain union with Him. You will attain immortal supreme peace and eternal bliss. This is the view of another school of thought.Sri Sankara very strongly refutes the idea that knowledge in conjunction with Karma (action) produces or leads to liberation. He says that Karma and knowledge may not go together in the same man? that karma helps the man to get purification of the heart? and that right knowledge of the Self alone will give him absolute freedom from Samsara. He says that work and knowledge are like darkness and light? that action is possible only in this universe of illusory phenomena which is the projection of ignorance and knowledge dispels this ignorance.

Krishna's saying, ditch all the rules, all the shoulds and shouldn'ts – the whole shebang. Just chill with me, bro. I got you. It's not about good deeds or bad deeds; it's about realizing we're all one, like, totally connected. If you get that, I'll free you from all the drama, all the guilt. No cap. Some peeps interpret this as like, total surrender – work your butt off, but give the credit to the big man upstairs. Others are like, nah, knowledge is key. It's about seeing the divine in everything, not getting caught up in the illusion of separate things. It's about letting go of the 'I am this, I am that' ego trip and realizing you're part of something way bigger. Basically, chill with Krishna, and you'll be straight."
